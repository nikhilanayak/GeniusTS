The drive to escape that hopelessness is, for the hustler, the same thing that drives a drug addict to get high-a need to escape. So here, and in other rhymes, I’m identifying with addicts.

Finish it, 'cause it sounds like you got a lot more to say.’","status":"accepted"},{"text":"While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely\n My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me","annotation":"This opening couplet is one of Jay’s most iconic, and has two possible meanings:\n\n\nDrug dealer – his enemies are watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake. Since his drugs (“shit”) make him a lot of money (“butter for the bread”), they want to kill him (continuing the carbs metaphor – “toast” him). Jay subtly lets us know that he is on top of the drug game–he is aware that people are out to get him, and is keeping tabs on the people who are keeping tabs on him, effectively turning the hunter into the hunted.\nRapper – he’s on stage, his fans are watching him at a concert (or otherwise keeping track of his song releases). His music (“shit”) makes him money, and his fans want to “toast” (honour) him.\n\n\n\nIn Decoded he said:\n\nIn this line, I turn a noun, bread (meaning “money”) into a verb, toast (meaning “shoot”), which draws out the relationship between money and danger.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be\n Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet","annotation":"His brain and his penis, both of which could lead him down dangerous path’s if he keeps them unchecked.\n\nRelationships are more complicated for those involved in the hustle: You never know if the girl you’re with isn’t just a decoy that your enemies use to get you into a vulnerable position (or may cause trouble for you because she was involved with another hustler before you that might catch feelings).\n\nJay has explored the topic regularly over the years, most notably in “D'Evils,” during the second verse when he uses an enemies girl to smoke him out and extract retribution.\n\nNote the wordplay with “track” and “feet,” and “clapped,” all having roots in sport (running the track in front of an audience).","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away","annotation":"From Decoded:\n\nSleeplessness, weariness, and adrenaline are symptoms of paranoia, of engaging in illegal activity in plain sight. “Four fiends away” indicates the distance between me and the street-level action. The implication is that I’m a boss, to some degree buffered from low-level workers who can be easily urged to cooperate with authorities.\n\nA similar situation was described in “Coming of Age”:\n\nlife could be better\nLike my man reclined in plush leather seats\nHe’s selling weight, I’m selling eight balls\n\nMemphis Bleek is explaining this exact line, but from a different perspective. He’s the the “brother” admiring Jay from four fiends away.","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"My pain, wish it was quick to see\n From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee","annotation":"A “fricassee” is a meal of diced or minced meat. Outwardly, Jay appears calm and at ease, but his brain is turned to mush from the anxiety and paranoia he experiences daily in his chosen profession.\n\nIt’s another example of Jay equating selling drugs to taking them. The way drugs scramble a fiends brains is equal to that of the stress a hustler deals with.\n\n“Fried to a fricassee” may have inspired this Cam'ron line.\n\n\n\nA better tasting fricassee","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me\n At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly\n My squad and me lack of respect for authority\n Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief","annotation":"This is a time to look back, to reminisce on his earlier days. The thrill was more important than the pain. As he said in Decoded:\n\nThe rewards – the money, the girls, the excitement… I wanted to tell stories and boast, to entertain and to dazzle… Balled ridiculously in Vegas, I went dead broke and got hood rich on those streets.\n\nJay’s “squad” was his drug-dealing crew, and the key is “escaping poverty.” During “Money, Cash, Hoes” he explained:\n\nYea I rap now, fast money, dun slowed up\n\nThe fast money on the streets is just that: fast. It comes and it goes, but when you’re living in the moment and not worrying about the consequences it can be beautiful.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I know this game got valleys and peaks","annotation":"Another example of Jay’s premise on Reasonable Doubt, to explain both the good and the bad (or the gift and the curse) of selling drugs. It can also be flipped into commentary on the drug game, and you could argue Jay was in one of his only valleys when he released this record.\n\nAs Jay said on “Dead Presidents”:\n\nI’m here to tell n—s it ain’t all swell\nThere’s heaven, and then there’s hell n—s\nOne day you’re cruising in your 7, next day you’re sweating, forgetting your lies","status":"verified"},{"text":"Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly\n The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in","annotation":"This may be directly influenced by a story Jay told in Decoded (page 90):\n\nOne day at the end of school I got arrested by the school cop for trespassing; I had crack in my pockets, but since it was my first arrest and I had no prior offenses, they released me on my own recognizance.

It was like [the album’s] mastering time, so I just sat down in the booth and wrote that [verse].”\n\nPer Irv Gotti in the August 2006 issue of XXL:\n\nJay actually wanted Nas on it. He just did one verse, and we was leavin' the second verse for Nas. But the Nas thing didn’t happen.

Gotti mentioned he believed Nas was also set to appear on the track. But after the OF member passed on the guest appearance, Jay got to work finishing the song.\n\nFrom what I remember, he actually didn’t write the full verse,” Gotti wrote in an e-mail to MTV News. “But since the verse was so long, he wrote a few words down, and that made him remember the whole verse.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle","annotation":"This is about the the interior of my mind.

He was the spokesperson for everything that we were doing.\n\nAsk any accountant and they will tell you leasing is the way to go. It’s up to a 100% tax deductible right off especially if you lease through your business. In these days cars lose value so rapidly and only a small portion can be written off on buys. Obviously Jay-Z is explaining that he has illegal drug money so I doubt he pays much in taxes, but the real life Jay-Z could have leased the car instead and written it off through Roc-A-Fella records.

But the Confederacy was ultimately beaten by the Union.  And what’s more, it stood for a morally disgusting cause simply because it sustained the southern economy.\n\nThe Confederacy and Jay’s confederation are thus directly compared, forcing us to ask ourselves how similar or different they really are/were.\n\n“explode!/On detonation” can also apply to the nation Jay’s crew is trying to overthrow, or to Jay’s mind which earlier in the verse is depicted as “infested with sick thoughts” and is “dual levels.”\n\nAlso note the world play on the homophonic ‘dead-a-nation’ and ‘detonation’, and also Jay’s masterful use of internal rhyme: ‘confederation’, ‘dead a nation’, ‘detonation’, ‘said patient’.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"When it boils to steam, it comes to it\n We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this","annotation":"Hov echo this sentiment on “Public Service,”  rapping:\n\nHope you don’t think users are the only abusers\nNiggas getting high within the game\n\nHis explanation of that line in *Decoded is applicable here as well.\n\nAnd it’s not just the material spoils that keep you going: You start getting addicted to the thrill of it, the adrenaline rush of going to see your connect in a small building in Harlem in a lobby that you’ve never been in, where you go in with a bag of money and come out with a bag of work. Or the feeling when you come around the corner back home and all eyes turn to you because everyone knows who you are — you represent something successful and free and dangerous, all at once. You have the best car, the best jewelry, the whole package. You taste a strange kind of fame. It’s as addictive as the shit you’re selling, and just as deadly.\n\n—Jay-Z, Decoded (p31)\n\n\n\nHe is suggesting throughout the whole album how his own doubt about life, turned into a drive to succeed. Here he implies that even “righteous” minds go through doubt.\n\n Also, he could be saying that when you get fed up enough with your circumstances (growing up in the mean streets of NYC), that hustling is what it comes down to.

Since the building block being controlled is so profitable it leads to many turf wars over control.\n\nAs a whole, this line frames the rest of Verse 2. It describes the origins of his relationship with a friend that he grew up with in the drug game that eventually becomes a bitter enemy of his. It also serves as a metaphor for Jay’s rise in the rap game from Hawaiian Sophie to Reasonable Doubt.\n\n\n\nIn a Reasonable Doubt documentary, Jay describes this line, saying:\n\n“When we was young fighting for those little building blocks, now we fighting for blocks with buildings. Like “I own that block”, you know? And the irony in that, you know, we grew up together so we learnt things together we learnt about our first jump shot, and our first time we rode a bike,  and the first time we learned how to use a condom”\n\nIt’s here: go to 27:45. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXfgKbp9ncQ","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers\n He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother","annotation":"In Decoded, Jay-Z’s book breaking down his rap lyrics, Jay singled out this couplet as one of his favorite lines from his work\n\nJay reminisces about an earlier, more innocent age when he and his friend were first learning to use condoms, and then connects it back to his current predicament. Since his friend never actually got the lesson and never used condoms, he impregnated a woman. Now Jay-Z is kidnapping that woman to gather information on his old friend’s whereabouts. This plays on the theme of the impossibility of innocence in the ghetto – having a kid, rather than being a joy, is a vulnerability.\n\nJay-Z in Decoded explains this line saying,\n\n“Here’s where the song takes a sudden turn from a general analysis and reminiscences to a clear narrative. I tried to convey a lot of information in one line: that we were friends so close that we learned basic sex ed at the same time; that he ‘never learned’, which sets him up as someone sloppier, less calculating and cunning than me; that he had a child as a result, and \"a baby’s mother”; and that I kidnapped her, which shows how profoundly “blackhearted” I had become, violently exploiting any opening – even the innocent mother of his child. The line goes from the innocence of two dumb kids learning to use condoms together, bypasses any happiness or joy about the birth of a child, and ends in a truly dark place. It’s the poison of “D'Evils” sketched out in a few words.\"","status":"accepted"},{"text":"My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese","annotation":"Jay-Z choking the woman to intimidate her into cooperation and then beginning to bribe her (cheese = money) into giving him information about the friend with whom he’s had a falling out.\n\nJay-Z in Decoded explains this line\n\nThe “cheese: is money, which I’m feeding her to try to get her to rat out the location of her man.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties\n About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced\n I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense","annotation":"Jay is trying to find this friend-turned-enemy so he keeps paying her. This finishes off the extended metaphor of feeding money: she doesn’t like the “taste” of the first cheese because it was a smaller amount, so he changes the cuisine and gives her bigger bills until she “shits out” the information he needs.\n\n“Shit started to make sense” is a play on words, it can be interpreted as what she was saying started to make sense as in she was telling the truth. But it also can be as she has been eating so much of his money that she started shitting out cents as in money.\n\nA deeper meaning that Jay probably wasn’t actually referring to (but is still interesting food for thought) is that the money the girl is fed appears in her shit, so it wasn’t completely absorbed. So it could be viewed as a commentary of man’s essential inability to ‘digest’ money.\n\nJay-Z in Decoded explains this line saying\n\nExtending the money-as-food metaphor, I keep feeding her larger bills till she shits out some information, the dollars breaking down to cents/sense as she digests them.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Who could ever foresee?\n We used to stay up all night at slumber parties\n Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep\n All the years we were real close\n Now I see his fears through her tears\n Know she's wishin' we were still close","annotation":"The narrator never would have thought when they were little going to slumber parties that he would grow up and try to “rock this bitch to sleep” (kill one of his best friends). But he is not completely cold hearted to the friend, he just feels the need to kill him is a business move (“it’s not personal, it’s strictly business”). Since our narrator is suffering from the same issues as his friend he sympathizes with him, and would still like to be friends with him if they weren’t rivals.\n\nAlternatively, the “bitch” that Jay has to rock to sleep could be the baby’s mama he kidnapped in the previous lines. He is either killing her to send a message, or trying to lull her into a false sense of security (“rock her to sleep”) so she is more willing to hand over the information he needs.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Don't cry, it is to be;","annotation":"The girl wishes that Jay-Z and the man in question were still close, because then she wouldn’t be being leaned on in this way.

He got the location of the man like he needed, and is ready to take things in his own hands. But he knows that “in time” the pain and suffering he caused to both the girl and his old friend will come back to haunt him. Pain, like matter and energy in the universe, never goes away, it merely gets transferred or rearranged.  Therefore, Jay absorbs the pain of all those he has wronged and has to carry it for the rest of his life.\n\nJay-Z in Decoded explains this line saying\n\nIn the end, I get her to do what I want, but it’s a grim victory. Not only will blood be shed based on the information she’s given me- hers and his- but the last vision of her, tears like a veil over her eyes, begging for both of their lives, is going to haunt me.

Now that emotion doesn’t factor into his decisions, he is willing to stick up anyone. But there is still some residual guilt, so even though he acts like he isn’t afraid to kill, he still blames his actions on others right before he takes out the victim.\n\nNotice the excesses/exorcist homophone, which ties in with material possessions being connected with the devil.\n\nJay-Z in Decoded explains this line saying,\n\nAnother quick scene: Possessed by material lust, the narrator sticks up random people. The quick line of dialogue is meant to show someone completely blinded by desire, reckless and aggressive, but also haunted, the kind of character who talks to his vics as he’s robbing them, making jokes and justifying himself by saying the whole world has done him wrong, so now everyone owes him.

He starts off as a shy, lonely white guy, who gets into a couple run-ins with black classmates. He turns to a white supremacist group to combat feeling powerless, eventually shooting up a multi-ethnic peace rally and then killing himself. Jay compares his decision to jump into the drug trade to Remy joining the group, as they both end up corrupting.\n\n\n\nAlso, Remy Martin is a brand of cognac.

He’s not completely aware of his actions and he’s ready to bust a cap / lick off at anyone who opposes him.\n\nJay Z is apologizing to his mom for what he’s about to do.\n\n\n\nThis is an example of how he disappointed his mom and gave her her fair share of pain.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers","annotation":"This is a play on the phrase “for the love of God”.

Jay-Z cites Satan’s suggestion that death be embraced (from the Book of Genesis: “In that day ye eat of that fruit ye shall die”) and in so doing shows that he accepts the “devil’s” authority.\n\nAdditionally Jay-Z is referring to the practice of selling one’s soul “for the love of money” and in turn receiving eternity in hell. If you go through with this, your fate is sealed no matter what, so you might as well enjoy your time on Earth instead of fearing your inevitable death the whole time. In the sense of this song, he is referring to how there is no turning back after the awful deeds he has done (kidnapping the girl, killing his friend, shooting at rival gangs, etc.), so it better have been worth it.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils","annotation":"This refers to the practice of killing a witness to a crime before that witness can testify against you. Jay claims that even if a god like Yahweh, who is supposed to have the highest morality in the universe witnessed this crime, Jay-Z would be able to intimidate Him into silence (note the play on the name of the Jehovah’s Witness religion).\n\nSince one of Jay’s nicknames is Jayhova, this could be him referring to himself in the third person and claiming that even if he saw someone else commit a crime, he would never snitch.\n\nJay-Z in Decoded explains this line saying:\n\nThe song ends with a dizzying carousel of conversations: First the narrator address his mother, then his girl (“boo), and finally a last victim. The narrator is completely lost to the \"D'Evils.” He taunts his victims, defends himself, brags about how low he gets down, invites niggas to try to come get him like George Bush saying “bring ‘em on” to the terrorists. The final two lines, contrasting the demons in his head with a God he thinks is powerless, show how deeply he’s fallen into a moral vacuum. The song isn’t about literal demonic possession, of course, even if some sloppy listeners claim that it is; the truth is you don’t need some external demon to take control of you to turn you into a raging, money-obesessed sociopath, you only need to let loose the demons you already have inside of you.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"\"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?\"\n \"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body\"","annotation":"Sets up the struggle between God and doing the right thing and the dark forces of capitalism that defines Jay-Z’s life and ghetto life in general.

His hands created a simple beat for him to practise his rhyming patterns over.\n\nI would just sit at the table, bang on it, and write these rhymes all day long. I remember this one, it was pretty good [laughs]. It was almost like foretelling what would happen. ‘I’m the King of Hip-Hop, renewed like Reebok, the King of the lock, with words so provocative, as long as I live … I didn’t view the hours that I sat at the table as working hard.

Jay turned to music instead and in 1994 he established Roc-A-Fella Records alongside Damon Dash and Kareem Burke. The label served as an outlet for Jay-Z to independently release his debut album Reasonable Doubt, which received widespread acclaim from critics and solidified his standing in hip-hop.\n\nIn an October 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Jay elaborated on his drug-dealing past:\n\nI was a drug dealer. To be in a drug deal, you need to know what you can spend, what you need to re-up. […] Things you can get in easily to get out of [that] life. At some point, you have to have an exit strategy, because your window is very small; you’re going to get locked up or you’re going to die.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much","annotation":"The first and fifteenth of every month are like the Sabbath of the Bone Thugsian calendar; these are the days government welfare checks are delivered, so drug dealers on those days know that they’re going to be able to sell a lot of drugs (this is the only consistent and stable feature of a drug dealer’s life)","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up","annotation":"As he made clear in his earlier song “Can I Live”, for Jay, selling drugs was just not a desirable career because it causes insomnia.\n\nSo I keep one eye open like C-B-S\n\nThis is also a double entendre. On one end he doesn’t sleep and keeps one eye open because he is always looking out for the cops as a dope dealer. The second meaning is hustlers (as in people on the grind/entrepreneurs) never sleep because they have one eye looking out for the next opportunity or the next deal.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And the drought will define a man when the well dries up\n You learn the worth of water without work\n You thirst 'til you die, yup!","annotation":"Hova talks about cocaine as it’s water (A common slang in the drug dealing world), so when there’s a drought and the supply of drugs runs out it’s the time in which the real men stand out, those who were able to save some money and had other forms of hustling. Jay always considered himself man, as he said in Can I Live:\n\nI know this game got valleys and peaks, expectation\nFor dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly\nThe youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in\nNo more Big Willie, my game has grown: prefer you call me William","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And niggas get tied up for product\n And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up\n To show mothers they really got 'em","annotation":"This is a reference to Rich Porter, a drug dealer who rose to prominence in Harlem in the mid-80s.

We ain’t have shit, but we was always cool about not having shit at that period and time. My mom was working, doing her thing, but I looked at other cats that used to come to my house and used to come play with my toys. We only had about two or three of them shits, but these niggas had none, so they over at my house everyday.\n\nAs a shorty, you might be dealing with, a father who’s a fucking career criminal, your mom’s on drugs. You ain’t got no discipline, you up all night, and you seeing shit you ain’t supposed to see. Niggas is blowing cigarette smoke in your face…weed in your face. They’re drinking and fucking, and you just a 10-year-old or 11-year-old. You get to see all that way ahead of your time. You’re seeing coke getting chopped on the table, guns and all kinds of shit at a young age. That young age is when your mind is the ripest, man. All that information is going on, and it gets sucked in. Your brain is young, and your brain is new. You catalogue all that, and that’s what you become. You become what your surrounding is.

Was there a time where you felt like you were suicidal at that point?\n\nInspectah Deck: [Laughs] Nah, man. I ain’t never been suicidal, dog. I’m too mentally strong for all that shit.\n\nDX: But when you ask, “What’s it worth?” there is a sense of hopelessness there, right?\n\nInspectah Deck: Yeah, there is a sense of hopelessness of being that child thinking, “Life as a shorty shouldn’t be so rough.” When you’re growing up rough like that—how I was just describing—you come into a point in life where it’s like, “Damn, I’ve been arrested three or four times. I got charges on my shit, and niggas don’t want to hire me.” You going through things with your girlfriend at the time. I wasn’t really going to school, but I always felt I was a smart nigga. I was raised on the street, and for me it was like, “Damn, you wind up at a dead end any way you go, whether it’s hustling…” If you get caught up, you losing money any time you get arrested.\n\nSo with the things adding up you’re like, “Damn.” You smoking, and you get high. For that temporary moment, you might think about some other shit, like, “Yo, remember when this was going down?” But then when that high is gone, you get right back into shit. If you’re depressed, you roll a blunt, and when your high is gone, you’re still depressed. I’m like, “What the fuck? What’s it worth? Why even smoke?” That’s what I mean in that line. I’m saying, “Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth.” It’s being ready to give up in the sense of, “Fuck trying to do this righteous shit and something happen. I’m ready to just go nose-dive right into the life now. I’m ready to either just become the kingpin or become the fucking clown and get taken out real quick.

Hov references his criminal past by stating that he jacks, robs, and sins, thus making him Jackie Robinsin\n\n\n\nThis is one of Hov’s, and rap’s, greatest triple entendre:\n\n\nWhen Jay “runs base” – sells drugs like freebase cocaine – he aims to dodge jail time in the penitentiary. Meanwhile in baseball Jackie Robinson is running bases, dodging so as to not to get tagged out and sent back to the pen scoreless. His high speed made him excellent at stealing bases. In his first year in the MLB he hit 12 home runs and helped the 1947 Dodgers win the National League pennant.\nA homophone of base/bass: When Jay raps along to the bass of the beat, he freestyles rather than writing raps beforehand. Therefore he is “dodging the pen.”\nThe pen Robinson isn’t dodging likely is the one that was used to sign his Brooklyn Dodgers contracts. Because Jay runs base (sells drugs), he doesn’t have to sign any paperwork, as his work is illegal.\n\n\n\nNote how Hov begins the verse with “I father” like a prayer. He later says “Aww man” – which sounds like “Amen” to end the prayer. God protecting him while he is jacking, robbing and sinning in his Brooklyn prayer.\n\nNew Yorkers used to call anyone from Brooklyn “trolley dodgers” because of the numerous street-car lines that criss-crossed the borough.

The club was well known Sunday hip hop night that was the setting for some of Hip Hop’s best performances, namely earlier performances by Biggie and Jay Z.\n\n“In the limelight” is also an idiom that means “to be a celebrity” or “to be in the public eye.” It comes from an old type of bulbs used for stage lighting, which contained the chemical “quicklime”.

He later made a cameo in Biggie’s “One More Chance” video.\nFunkmaster Flex is a Bronx DJ known for his shows on KISS-FM in the late ’80s and Hot 97 starting in 1992. He conducted Biggie’s first radio interview in 1994 on Hot 97.\nLovebug Starski was a Bronx DJ known for appearing at pioneering hip-hop clubs Disco Fever and Harlem World, staring in the late ’70s. He claims to have helped invent the word “hip-hop” with Furious 5’s Cowboy.\n\n\n\nRon G remembered a pre-“Juicy” Biggie in a 2014 Nah Right interview:\n\nHe would always come to my house, and talk about how he wanted to be rich.

The show featured interview segments where Leach got up close and personal with wealthy celebrities and socialites.\n\n\n\nThe “Juicy” music video features a pool party at a mansion in The Hamptons, a scene straight out of an episode of Lifestyles. Big’s even being interviewed by a reporter, which he mentions (“interviews by the pool”) later in this verse.\n\nPrior to Biggie, a number of artists had referenced Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous in their music, including Ice Cube, Ice-T, CL Smooth, Akinyele, R. Kelly, 2 Live Crew, Lakim Shabazz, Original Flavor, Above The Law, and Master P.\n\nIn the October 1994 issue of The Source, Miss Info made a pun on the show’s title in her review of Biggie’s debut, Ready To Die:\n\nLike a lyrical version of the movie The Killer, Big weaves tales like a cinematographer. Each song is like another scene in his Lifestyles of the Black and Shameless, the Tec and the stainless.\n\nIt’s also possible that Biggie’s use of the word “change” is a double entendre—he changed his life, but he also made change (as in small money) when he was a common thief.\n\nUsing the phrase “common thief”—an old British expression—gives Big an air of sophistication.

In 1995, likely inspired by Big, both R. Kelly and Jodeci mentioned the mix of Moët and Alizé on songs.\n\nIn 1996, 2Pac wrote an entire song about the mix of champagne and Alizé, which he dubbed “Thug Passion” (although he replaced Moët with a more expensive brand, Cristal). He shouts out Alizé throughout All Eyez On Me, including this reference:\n\nYo, two years ago, a friend of mine\nTold me Alize and Cristal blows your mind\n\nWas 2Pac’s “friend” Biggie?

He didn’t want to change the world, like maybe 2Pac did. Biggie was a very simple guy, whose main goal was to provide for his family.\n\nInteresting note: five karats refers to gold or diamonds with 5 fine parts per 24 whole, i.e. a 5/24 purity with 24/24 being the highest possible.

PE frontman Chuck D, who doesn’t drink or smoke, was not pleased about his voice being used in a song about selling crack. He sued Biggie’s estate and settled out of court.\n\nThe number “6” from this intro went onto be the same “6” tag Drake uses. It was also used by Lin-Manuel Miranda in the song “Ten Duel Commandments” from the musical Hamilton.\n\n\n\nThe reason why the original sample only counts to 9 is because this song was a demo originally made for Angie Martinez’s Hot 97 radio show. The 10 was added later after Puff Daddy heard the countdown on the show and asked Premier if he could buy the promo, as DJ Premier explained:\n\nThat was actually a promo that me and Jeru did for Angie Martinez on Hot 97. Back then she did a show called the “Hot 5 at 9″ where she would play the top 5 records at 9 o’clock. If you listen to the scratches, before I added “ten” later on when Biggie got it, I just keep going to five right after the beat drops because it was for the top 5 at 9. Puffy was guest hosting the show and when he heard the promo he was like “what the hell, who did this?” and Angie told him I did it. So he goes live on the radio like “yo Premier, if you’re out there, call me.” One of my homeboys paged me and told me that Puffy was on the radio telling me to call him. I turn on Hot 97 and right before I was about to turn the dial off, I hear “Premier, Premier, please call me if you hear me on the radio.” He told me he wanted to buy the promo. I told Jeru and he was like “yo, it’s hip hop. No big deal.” So I sold it to him and Biggie already had a concept, he wanted to call it “Ten Crack Commandments.” I took the “Ten” from a spaceship count down when they go “ten, nine, eight, seven…” And Biggie just rapped over it right there.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"It's the ten crack commandments, what?\n Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke\n Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas","annotation":"Biggie began dealing crack at age 12 on Fulton Street between St. James Place and Washington Avenue.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas","annotation":"Although B.I.G. has made it “big,“ he doesn’t plan on forgetting about his friends on the street still dealing drugs.\n\nA triple beam balance is used to accurately measure quantities of chemicals or street drugs.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal\n There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual\n A step-by-step booklet for you to get\n Your game on track, not your wig pushed back","annotation":"Many believe B.I.G drew inspiration for this song from the July 1994 issue of The Source magazine.\n\n\n\nThe list of “A Crack Dealer’s Ten Crack Commandments” read:\n\n\n\nNever let anyone know how much money you have.\nNever let anyone know what your next move will be.\nTrust no one.\nNever use what you sell.\nNever give credit.\nNever sell out of your home.\nKeep family and business separate.\nNever park your stash on your person.\nIf you’re not being arrested, never be seen communicating with the police.\nG.C.G.C.

On this day, there were a pair of black 9-millimeter Rugers under the mattress in his bedroom. “I’m not paranoid to the point where—” He paused. “Yes, I am. I’m scared to death.

The first, referenced in rule #6, is the extension of credit to customers, which should be avoided at all costs. The other, alluded to in rule #10 and in “Everyday Struggle,” is the practice of selling on consignment. This practice is encouraged and celebrated by Big, but only for the “live men\"—those with the distribution to be able to move product and then pay back their suppliers.\n\nAlso note the play on words with “dead it” and “deb-it\"—you should stop giving credit to buyers, instead they should owe you a \"debit.”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Seven: this rule is so underrated\n Keep your family and business completely separated\n Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch\n Find yourself in serious shit","annotation":"Biggie draws parallels between two men having sex and doing business with your family.

Over three weeks this girl sniffed 500 grams of cocaine, equivalent to around $11,000. “Pie” is also slang for kilo of cocaine. Cocaine is called “cake” due to its similar appearance to the off-white baking flour used in cakes.\n\n“Your girl fucked my man Jake up” is a play on words with the name “Jake” and the adjective “jake,“ which can mean in good standing.

Lucy\n'Member they back you down, when knives was out\n.45 was out, scully ya eyes come out\nBut now cuz you hear nigga all in his place\nThat when you see him in the streets, you gettin' all in his

more, you's a fraud and a snake\nBut you noticed that's the hate that I love\nYou see me eatin' off rap, that same feat you think you capable of\nDon't get me wrong, I would like to dead it\nBut you actin' like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish\nAnd my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's\nThis is the wrong time to fuck with my head\nI'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst

Though he can’t remember the first MC who heard the instrumental, he does recall playing it for two New York giants: Jay Z and Nas.\n\n“Hip-Hop former A&R at “Roc-A-Fella Records” is my man and I used to go over there [Baseline Studios] and play beats,” the producer recounts. “One day, I was there, Jay came in the room, heard it—and, you know, that’s the regular occurrence if you’re going to go to Roc-A-Fella at that time and play beats. If he wanted it, he would have been like ‘Yeah, I need that.’”\n\nNas, on the other hand, did show some interest in the track, but the “Queensbridge” lyricist didn’t move fast enough. “He had it,” Al says, acknowledging that Nas came close to recording on the heater. “I tracked it for him and it never happened. I don’t know what happened.”\n\nShopping the beat eventually sparked controversy. Upon the release of Jadakiss’s single, West Coast wordsmith Ras Kass took issue with Alchemist selling the track to Jada because he’d already recorded a song of his own titled, “Home Sweet Home” over the same instrumental. Ras had planned on the cut being the lead single to his forthcoming LP, Van Gogh, but Al reportedly began shopping the track again when his attempts to receive the second half of his payment from “Priority Records”—Ras’s label at the time—had been unsuccessful.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Fuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in\n They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with","annotation":"He’s getting in so much coke they need to weigh it on a whale scale!

Since there is more empty space, the smoke molecules are pulled to the empty space than in normal air.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?","annotation":"“You’re tough, but I’m tougher.”\n\nThat seems to be the obvious interpretation. But then Weezy answered a question about the line in an ESPN blog post and managed to make me more confused.\n\nReader Question: Why is a goon nothing compared to a goblin? And are the Raiders the Goons of the NFL and the Titans the Goblins?\nLil Wayne’s Answer: Let’s say you’re a goon. Well, what’s a goon to a goblin? Nothing. They’re the same thing. So are the Raiders goons and the Titans the goblins? No, because the Titans are having an amazing year and the Raiders have been not so amazing. If you’re going for a goons and goblins reference, I would say if you’re calling Oakland goons I would use Jacksonville or St. Louis as goblins. Or if you want to use the Titans as goons, the Giants would be your goblins. You gotta pick teams that are on the same page when you making that analogy.\n\nWayne would later re-use the goon/goblin comparison as part of his hook in “We Be Steady Mobbin” featuring Gucci Mane.\n\nSome might say Lil Wayne’s toughness stems not only from his “goblin” status, but from the fact that he (and, let’s face it, only he) really knows the relation of a goon to a goblin.\n\nBased off of Wayne’s own words, this line equates his enemies as goons to goblins, they’re the same thing. So when you compare a goon to a goblin, there’s nothing to compare, since they’re the same. Translation: his enemies are nothing, which he states in the following line.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman","annotation":"Dennis Rodman (arguably the greatest rebounder in NBA history) played for the Chicago Bulls during a good chunk of his career; hence the wordplay of “Bull shit”.

His first album is entitled Resonable Doubt, a play on the leap of faith he was taking pursuing rap as a career over the streets.\n\nHe’d later go on to say:\n\nLondon, England, South of France\nAnd all points between they know about your man\nKonichiwa ladies when I’m out in Japan\nI’m a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am\nPiss poor n—- from the hood but I blew\n\nHe could have just as easily gone back to that poor hood persona.\n\n“If I wasn’t driving” refers to taking public transport, although Jay rarely drives in his current financial state, preferring to let a professional take care of that.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga","annotation":"Although Jay had yet to make real money in the rap game (that would come soon on this very album, selling 5 million copies), he didn’t enter it empty handed. During “U Don’t Know” he raps:\n\nI came in to this motherfucker hundred grand strong\nNine to be exact, from grinding G-packs\n\nJay, Dame and Kareem Burke started Roc-A-Fella with their own money, so for Jay to be worth over $10 million is no stretch at this point in his career. He was entirely independent, apart from a distribution deal with Def Jam.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Would you come around me or would you clown me","annotation":"This line has a direct root in “Where I’m From”, when Jay raps:\n\nAnd girls in the projects wouldn’t fuck us, said we talked too much\nSo they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust\nI don’t know what the fuck they thought, those n—s is foul just like us\n\nDuring the film Streets Is Watching there is a specific scene where women are seen dissing Jay and his friends and leaving them, “clowning” them for dressing the way they do and rapping.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya\n Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya","annotation":"This harks back to his days in The Originators, using incredibly complex and fast flows that incorporated stacked rhymes and triplets.\n\nIt was more about the technique than what I was saying. I was trying to say things in different ways—doing faster flows and triplet styles. It was more of a technical thing\n\nJay even felt he had “pioneered” the triple rhyming style, saying in Decoded:\n\nI’d just go in on it in the breakneck double and triple time rhyming that me and Jaz thought we’d pioneered.\n\nHis flow has been imitated in subsequent years, most famously by his protégé Young Chris, whose had to defend both himself and Jay in the ensuing controversy.\n\nIf Jay wasn’t a rapper, would this girl even care? Would she be attracted to him if he wasn’t spitting rhymes?","status":"accepted"},{"text":"See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five\n Ten to six, two jobs to survive,","annotation":"Jay actually worked even harder than this pre-rap, recalling in Decoded a time when he was arrested carrying cocaine, released, and had to work “sixty straight hours” to make back what he’d lost.\n\nA kid from Marcy owed me money, so I went out with him on the streets and worked for sixty straight hours. I would give him work to sell, wait while he turned it around, then take that money uptown to cop more work. I kept him working three nights in a row, his girl brought him sandwhiches in the middle of the night.\n\nClearly someone maintained a relationship through such trying conditions, and Jay had his own version of this dedication before he made it big.\n\nThis statement is in response to the wave of female interest he was experiencing since becoming a rapper. During the N.O.R.E. Rap Radar Podcast he related a story about Hov in the very early days and his ways with women:\n\nI hooked up Hov with a couple of chicks from back in my hood back in the days. I was kind of mad, Elizabeth and them, they just went over there, what the fuck he’s doing, fuck him! No, he was hotter, “Ain’t No” was hotter I can’t lie.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Or\n Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up\n Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya","annotation":"Jay wasn’t quite on his “Girl’s Best Friend” bent yet. This single came out September 1998, the first from the album. While Jay did brag about money a lot prior to this track, it was rarely in relation to women. The exception was “Imaginary Player,” which introduced one of the strongest floss games to emerge in hip hop.\n\nThe less said about “I Know What Girls Like” the better…","status":"accepted"},{"text":"If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low\n Baby girl, if this is so, yo","annotation":"Ironically Jay had created a situation where this scenario would never again play out in his future. It doesn’t seem borne of any life experience, although in “Song Cry” he raps:\n\nUsed to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn’t touch me\nThen I showed up in that dubbed out buggy\nAnd then they got fuzzy and they don’t remember that\nAnd I don’t remember you\n\nImplying he didn’t become attractive until he turned up in an expensive whip. This is an early example of the “Gold Digger” mentality, and Jay want’s no part of it.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Can I get a woop woop\n To these niggas from all of my bitches\n Who don't got love for niggas without dubs","annotation":"The female response, refusing to mess with a guy who is broke.

If each member of an entourage has their own identity, and their own way of making money, if one of them falls the others can pick them up. Jay’s basically laying out the blueprint for how he would run Roc-A-Fella, although it didn’t quite work out that way.\n\nEssentially, Jay remained the key piece of the money-making puzzle. If he ever fell off, his friends would too, which was exemplified by the split of The Roc and Dame Dash and Kareem Burke’s subsequent financial failures.\n\nEven Memphis Bleek, who achieved Gold success more than once on the label, is still reliant on Jay’s name, although he works incredibly hard himself.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Chorus: Mecca]","annotation":"Per Village Voice, Mecca was just 17 when Ski flew her from Virginia to NYC to sing this hook.\n\nAs Mecca tells it:\n\nI was there with Ski, and he and I created the melody together, and then Ski came up with the lyrics.\n\nOr as Ski tells it:\n\n[Mecca] got paid for singing, obviously.

He’s been very vocal on tracks though:\n\nTil you heard the cries of my mama, me givin her drama\nTold her I ain’t promised tomorrow, gotta live for the day\nAnd before she could say Jay…\nI was out the door, pouch full of raw, a outlaw mentality\n\nThe “sniper” in this instance most likely refers to the Feds, whom Jay was slightly paranoid about at the time:\n\n you gotta know\nIt always crossed my mind that Feds be tappin the lines like Gregory Hines\n\nBy this point Jay was out of the game for good, so he can look back on it with a more calm frame of mind.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot","annotation":"The nightmares that he might get shot cause him anxiety, nerves. During “Regrets” he admits to being scared, but on “Can I Live” he’s defiant, saying “I’d rather die enormous than live dormant.” These lines are somewhere between the two extremes.

He’s self commenting on how weed disorients your train of thought.\n\nHe’s confused whether or not to get out of the game.  His mom is scared of him getting killed, and he has already made millions.  But the attention from the girls the pecks that come with the drug-dealing life make this a hard decision.\n\nThe verse flows in a probing fashion. Jay is painting a picture of an inner struggle to quit the game of drug dealing as well as the burden of knowing his loved ones(mom most pointedly) are worried about how this is going to end for him. His confusion is with all these choices and decisions he has to make and then it gets so bad, he succumbs to smoking weed, something he’s been against just to show the listener how vulnerable he’s feeling by the end of this verse. He’s aware of the contradiction and he doesn’t need you to add any further chastising to his already tormented/confused state of mind.. Just let him be…","status":"accepted"},{"text":"It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do\n And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through","annotation":"Hov employs the idiom “one in a blue moon” here to describe how he rarely smokes marijuana.

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)","annotation":"These lines are silly, but thought was put into them. This was Eminem’s first ever real single, and he knew that his career relied on its success. So he made sure to make a mark from the very first line, roping in the children that would become big supporters of his music. (the phrase is even followed by childish screams of “YEAH!”)\n\nThis question pokes fun at how parents will allow their kids to watch cartoons like Tom & Jerry that desensitizes violence without thinking twice, but then place blame on controversial artists like him when their kids start acting out. Eminem knows that kids are already attracted to violence by all of the aggression that surrounds them in the media, and wants to bring attention to the fact that it isn’t just rap music that is ruining everyone’s perfect little boys and girls.\n\n\n\n“Violence” was changed to “Primus” on the clean version. They’re an American rock band, which correlates with the NiN reference in the next line.\n\nPrimus is the band responsible for the South Park Theme. South Park is actually a lot like the TV version of Eminem; it is controversial, it deals a lot with pop culture, and it depicts the negative impacts of the media on kids in a humorous way. Eminem is actually a big fan of the show and compares himself to one of the characters on the show in a later song (Cartman). Eminem establishes the South Park connection to show that there is more than one outlet influencing the youth of America.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)","annotation":"Eminem references the controversial rock band Nine Inch Nails here, highlighting the idea that rappers aren’t the only ones responsible for driving the youth to violence; there is television, movies, and rock music.\n\nThe literal meaning of the line, is that kids would probably laugh if they saw him sticking nails through his eyelids, because they are desensitized to violence and respond well to shock tactics.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)\n Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)","annotation":"Slim is sarcastically prompting his younger audience to view him as a Role Model although he clearly has all of the traits that depict him as the exact opposite of one.\n\n“‘cid” is short for “acid”, the common nickname given to LSD, a very powerful drug that induces strong and vivid hallucinations.\n\nAlso note that at this point in time, Eminem’s life was miles from good: it was so messed up that it could be compared to the effects of taking LSD. Examples of how difficult his life was is seen throughout The Slim Shady LP (see “If I Had”, “Brain Damage”, and “Rock Bottom”)","status":"accepted"},{"text":"My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight","annotation":"The constant self-debauchery and drug use has left Em’s brain fried to uselessness. So his brain isn’t really doing anything for him, it’s just sort of floating around in his skull.\n\nThis line is also a bit of wordplay on the homophone weight/wait: “My brain’s dead, wait, I’m trying to get my head straight.”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)","annotation":"The Spice Girls were a Margaret Thatcher-inspired world famous Brit pop girl band, and hate-fucking female pop stars is a theme in Eminem’s radio songs (see also the reference to Pamela Lee a couple lines down).\n\nIn “The Real Slim Shady” it’s Christina Aguilera, and in “I’m Back” it’s Jennifer Lopez.\n\n\n\nAllegedly, this line was inspired by radio show DJ’s constantly asking Eminem which Spice Girl he would date if he had the choice. He got sick of this question and decided to parody it in his song.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And Dr. Dre said, \"Slim Shady, you a basehead\" (Uh-uh)\n \"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted\"","annotation":"It’s Dr. Dre calling him a “basehead” (another word for “crackhead”) that makes Eminem fantasize about killing him in “The Real Slim Shady”.\n\nThis line also shows the world that Eminem has a Dr. Dre co-sign. Em was relatively unknown to the masses before this song came out, so he had to draw attention to himself in his first real single; the respect from a hip-hop legend like Dre helped achieve this.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else\n 'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt","annotation":"Slim Shady “killed” Marshall Mathers to become famous, and that’s what led to the identity crisis and multiple personalities. This line is later referenced in the song “Insane” off of his album Relapse.\n\nThe bastard won’t even eat nothing, he’s scared\nHe just hung himself in the bedroom, he’s dead!\n\nEm actually did try to commit suicide after Infinite came out but before he invented Slim Shady. Saying he “hung his original self” is true to his real life.\n\n\n\nThe censored version of this lyrics is just as awesome:\n\nSince age 12 I felt like a caged elf\nWho stayed to himself in one space, chasing his tail\n\nEveryone knows that Em hates censors, but he realizes that there’s nothing he can do about it. So instead of just putting 5 seconds of silence in the song and sounding ridiculous, he rewrote the lyrics so even the censored version of the song would sound good. There’s actually a great RapGenius blog post about rewriting lyrics for the censors.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off","annotation":"Pamela Anderson married Tommy Lee in ‘95 and became Pamela Anderson Lee for a few years. Some believed that this was a jab at Kid Rock since Pamela was his ex-wife, but the two didn’t even meet until after this song was released. He probably just mentioned her because, well, there’s a lot to rip off.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe edited version of these lyrics read:\n\nGot ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee’s lips off\nKissed em and said “I didn’t know silicone was supposed to be this soft!”\n\nWhich is a reference to her plastic surgery","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross","annotation":"Kriss Kross was an early 1990’s rap/hip hop duo, made up of Chris “Mac Daddy” Kelly and Chris “Daddy Mac” Smith, best known for their hit song “Jump.” They were only 12 and 13 years old when they recorded their first album and were well known for wearing their clothes backwards.\n\nOn an interesting note, Jermaine Dupri discovered this group – Dre and Dupri have famously had beef with each other for years.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass\n Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast\n Come here, slut; \"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg\"\n I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off","annotation":"Slim is not the most flattering person ever, and this is a prime example of his twisted mind: he points out an overweight woman in the rudest way possible and then proceeds to seduce her away from her man.\n\nNote that in the clean version of this song, “God” is replaced with “Dre”, most likely due to the relative cultural insensitivity of saying God’s name in vain.\n\nAlso when he says “Come here, slut; “Shady, wait a minute, that’s my girl, dawg”“ the phrase \"girl, dawg” is a play on the word Bitch.

Just don’t bring that shit around me.\n\nOpenly gay musician Labi Siffre, whose song “I Got The” was sampled for this song, insisted the line be changed.\n\nEm did, in fact, fail 9th grade three times, showing that the altered lines are reflective of both him personally and Slim Shady.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up\n Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup","annotation":"This plays off the idea that dudes who wear trench coats are naked underneath and ready to flash people.

She settled for $25,000, but ended up only walking away with $1,600.\n\nAt this time, Eminem was also using drugs, only recreationally at the time, but still says that his mom uses more than him.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper\n Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her\n (Oh, thank you)","annotation":"Eminem did eventually make a song claiming his drug habit stemmed from the fact that his mom force-fed him pills as a child, ten years later.

With this came an expansion of his fanbase, as even women started to take interest in the Detroit MC.\n\nThis led to a popularity among females that closely resembled that of R&B singer, Usher. You can even hear women screaming in the background.

This is a classic example of an Eminem lyric that doesn’t necessarily mean what the words suggest. However, he does get on a more serious note in the track “The Way I Am” which was released on his next album The Marshall Mathers LP.\n\nAnd I’m thankful for every fan that I get\nBut I can’t take a shit\nIn the bathroom without someone standing by it\nNo, I won’t sign you an autograph\nYou can call me an asshole, I’m glad\n\nThis lyric was later referenced in the skit interlude of “Asshole” on his 2013 album The Marshall Mathers LP2 and even later in the poster of his Kamikaze album.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Hi, my name is, what?

Basically, they’d say to stop playing his music and put him in prison.\n\n\"Stop the tape!\" is the recording media equivalent of “stop the presses!” (printed media, usually printing newspapers), a phrase for when something is wrong.\n\nWhen he says “Stop the tape!”, the beat really stops. And once he finishes the phrase there’s an ad-lib.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate","annotation":"Dr. Dre produced “My Name Is”, and right when this line comes on the background track changes.

He even features a mummy on the album artwork to The Slim Shady LP.\n\n\n\nEven though this is mostly a joking line about how he viewed death differently than others, he is actually trying to get a point across. Some people thought them Em didn’t care about his life when he was coming up, so he clarified that he valued his life in a way that is still humorous.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide\n I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?

He is the alter-ego of a mild-mannered doctor named Bruce Banner. When Banner is put under a heavy amount of emotional stress, he physically transforms into a large, muscular monster with green skin. Any clothes Banner was wearing will rip apart because the transformation makes his body much larger.\n\n\n\nEm read a lot of comic books when he was a kid, and has made other references to the Incredible Hulk in his songs, such as in “Careful What You Wish For”, “Cold Wind Blows” and “Drop The World”. Em walks around with ripped clothes like Hulk does, but it’s likely his clothes are ripped because he was so poor at the time this song was written.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)","annotation":"If you’ve ever rapped for extensive periods your mouth starts to foam up which results in you spitting when you talk.

At first he tried to reach out to him through letters, but they were sent back every time, so his desire to meet his dad turned to hatred. He has bashed his dad in his lyrics numerous times to try and vent his anger towards him (see “Cleanin' Out My Closet”, “Hailie’s Song”, “Rhyme or Reason”).\n\nThe irony here is that the “My Name Is” music video states “Starring Marshall Mathers” at the beginning, which is actually Em’s father’s name as well (Eminem is Marshall Mathers III, his father is Marshall Mathers Jr.) So when his half-brother Michael Mathers and half-sister Sarah Mathers saw that, they thought it was referring to Marshall Mathers II (even though the song was actually about slitting MMII’s throat…).\n\nWhen Em’s dad heard about all this he finally tried to contact him, but it was far too late at that point. And Sarah and Michael were actually referenced in a later song called “Marshall Mathers” where they were called out for trying to reunite with him after he got famous, but they were ignored when they tried to reach out to him as well.\n\n\n\nEminem has softened with his views on Kim and his mother as the years go on, but the one constant has been his anger towards his father. His reasoning for this is that since he is now a father he could never imagine someone running out on his daughter like he did to Em.\n\n\n\nThe edited version of the lyric is just as venomous\n\nAnd by the way, when you see my dad\nAsk him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad\n\nHere, Eminem tells the listener to inform the father who abandoned him that he is featured in a pornographic magazine advertisement. These ads typically sell pornographic movies, sex toys and phone sex lines. In other words, he is sarcastically saying, “Dad, look what the son you left behind does for a living,” and implying that it’s his fault.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Hi, my name is, what?

So Kanye is simply saying it’s crazy how you can go from being classed as average to being classed as super-star and having everybody on you and buzzing off you which in his terms is “everybody on your dick”.

DeNiro called him “rude [and] disrespectful,” with Hov replying that the veteran actor hadn’t shown him enough respect:\n\nIt doesn’t matter who you are, everybody has to be respectful and everybody has to be a human being, you know?

Here Hov openly lambastes those in that category, suggesting that they are only superficially listening to his discography—judging it solely off tracks such as “Big Pimpin'” and “Money, Cash, Hoes;” while ignoring introspective cuts such as “Where I’m From,” “You Must Love Me” and “This Life Forever.”\n\nIn his 2010 autobiography Decoded Jay pointed out the target of these lines:\n\nThis is directed at critics who only listen to songs that fulfill their preconceived notions-the ‘bling bling’ in the background summarizes their usual complaint about my music.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined","annotation":"JAY-Z references his humble origins in Brooklyn, New York, where he grew up in a rundown neighborhood.

In an interview with GQ magazine, Jay described growing up in the ghetto and the hardships he faced:\n\nIt’s like crabs in a barrel. You’ve seen crabs trying to get out of the barrel? They pull each other down, trying to get up. They just grabbing at whatever they can. People are at the point where they’re ready to do anything so it’s very dangerous.

It also sets up a syncopated and prosaic flow of enjambment  to give the verse a feeling prosaic sentences instead of lines (e.g. “The block where they / pop toasters”).\n\nIf he’s going to do art, he’s going to do it “through and through,” his own way; as he says, “the secret of long-term success is the freedom just to be yourself,” and no one gave him that freedom. He took it.\n\nThe flow in the actual version is great because it emphasizes “doing” – (“B.I.G. I did it!”).

When we report the news, it doesn’t sound the same as when you hear it from CNN.

Hov is essentially blaming the behavior of the guys that pop toasters on the fact that they didn’t have fathers growing up.

So as a result the young lady had sex behind her parents' backs.\n\n“Knocked down” after being “knocked up” because getting pregnant was a misfortune rather than a joyous event as it is in middle-class families. The mother is left to raise the child by herself like many other inner-city women\n\nThis section can also be a reflection on Jay’s childhood. His father (who he says numerous times he doesn’t want to be like) knocked up his mother because she didn’t have someone looking out for her. That clown reference is to his father who left Jay as a child with his mother to raise by herself with no child support payments.\n\nSidenote: Jay-Z in Decoded explains a part of this line saying; “Again I’m talking about the flipside of the Money, Cash, Hoes” type songs.

But I always wondered how they could try to pin down and attach a rating to music that was really helping people understand their own lives. I always thought that critics should factor the truthfulness of the thyme. Truth is a constraint. It’s easy to make up a complete fantasy in a song. Trying to rhyme and be witty and tell a coherent story or talk about a coherent concept and stick to something true about life is difficult.

They’ve got nothing else to contribute to the world, while Jay-Z (as said in the last line) helps kids survive the ghetto life through his music.\n\nIn Decoded jay explains this line saying; “This is meant both literally and figuratively – the critic.

In particular, Em’s February 1999 album The Slim Shady LP\" was extremely controversial for pushing the limits on taboo themes and attempting to distance himself from the conventional ideologies.\n\nEm’s music is considered negative due to his tendency to incite violence, promote misogyny, encourage domestic abuse, and advertise excessive drug consumption.\n\nEminem reasons that he is wrongfully portrayed as a “bad person” in the media and that people are incorrectly assigning blame to him that he doesn’t deserve. Em previously attempted to prove that he wasn’t a inspirational figure on his February 1999 track, “Role Model,” where he described his various flaws:\n\nNow, follow me and do exactly what you see\nDon’t you wanna grow up to be just like me?\nI slap women and eat shrooms, then OD\nNow, don’t you want to grow up to be just like me?","status":"accepted"},{"text":"But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it","annotation":"Refers to the censorship of his lyrics on the radio and MTV, and protests against his supposed homophobia and misogyny.

Eminem is pointing out the hypocrisy of parents branding him a drug addict, even though it’s very likely they themselves experimented with drugs at some point in those pre-Reagan counter-cultural years.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)","annotation":"Eminem takes a shot at parents taking a moral high-ground towards him and his music, when a lot of them are probably part of a troubled marriage, which is negatively impacting on their children more than he is.\n\nAlso, upon close inspection the pure technical brilliance of this verse emerges; Em has been using multi-compound syllable rhyming of 5 syllables consistently since his third line (“shoes fits I’ll wear it”). Try going through the verse and counting all the times he uses words that rhyme with “shoe” and you’ll realize that almost the entire verse is comprised of internal rhymes and other poetic devices.  For example:\n\ntruth – grin – and – bear – it\nlu – cra – tive – lyr – ics\nwho – could – in – her – it…\n\nA true rap genius.\n\nAlso notice the “o” assonance in the verse. It already starts way back in the beginning of the verse, at “if the shoe fits”, and doesn’t stop until the end of the verse.\n\nYou fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn’t do good at marriage\nAnd do you have any clue what I had to do to get here","status":"accepted"},{"text":"'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga","annotation":"If you are familiar with the the original—Bad Meets Evil's—\"Renegade,\" you know this line is a replacement.

Therefore, Eminem introduced JAY-Z by his nickname, Jigga, all with a onomatopoetic flourish reminiscent of Eminem’s “My Name Is.”\n\nEm later reused this sound in the beginning of his feature verse on Logic’s 2019 single “Homicide,” in which he raps:\n\nJigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z\nJig is up, you fuckers who didn’t write anything","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a","annotation":"Telling people to kiss his ass is a common command in Eminem songs.

By “iron under my coat”, Hov is conveying that with a pistol under his coat he felt braver and even safer, due to the volatile environment in which he lived.

I went straight stopped selling drugs but I also didn’t accept the false choice between poverty and breaking the law. I found my own way through and with my music, I try to help others see their way through it, too.”\n\nIn his former life he had 2 choices – be poor, or deal drugs (risky!). He avoided being poor and avoided the usual consequences of dealing drugs (jail, death) by getting out early enough and becoming a successful rapper. By going straight, he “chose my own fate” and made his own path in the road.\n\nNote the pun on the phrase “going straight” (meaning a former criminal who starts obeying the law)\n\nTo quote Yankees star Yogi Berra (and/or poet Robert Frost):\n\nIf you see a fork in the road, take it!\n\nAlso, Jay-Z pays homage to Cappadonna’s “Slang Editorial”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Verse 4: Eminem]","annotation":"Considered by many to be his best verse of all time, this final section of the song deals with the complications of critics and the media, and how he just doesn’t care what they say.\n\n“See it’s a matter of taste/we the people decide if shadys as bad they say he is”–Eminem raps, saying the people decide if he’s any good.\n\nThe final stanzas of this verse contain many religious symbols and outright shots at Christians, Catholics, and Mormons.

Generally, an atheist doesn’t believe in supernatural beings, such as God or the devil, so an atheistic satanist is oxymoronic. However, the use of scatter-brained, in addition to keeping the rhyme with Latter-day, acknowledges that Em’s thoughts aren’t the result of carefully considered doctrines of belief, so he could be both at the same time, a sentiment he similarly addressed much later in his career.\n\nLike William Shakespeare, Em wrote a twisted version of “Romeo and Juliet” – the main difference – he murders Juliet.","status":"verified"},{"text":"We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is\n Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?","annotation":"Since Slim Shady is a whole other person than Eminem, Eminem belongs to “we as a people”.

Cubin is refering to the lyrics from “Kill You”:\n\nShut up slut, you’re causing too much chaos\nJust bend over and take it like a slut, OK Ma?\n‘Oh, now he’s raping his own mother, abusing a whore,\nsnorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?\n\nThe funny part is – in these lyrics – Eminem is satirizing his critics!!!! (I guess Barbara missed the joke..)\n\nBut the best part about this whole line (and the entire idea) is that Slim Shady does not exist. He is the fictional altar ego of Eminem. Therefore, if people (ie. critics, parents, etc.) take him seriously, his influence is just that much greater. But if they realize that what he is saying isn’t real, and take his words with a grain as salt, people wouldn’t view as bad as they do now.\n\nIt’s worth adding that in context it means it’s up to us to decide if he’s hurting the youth like “they” say he is, or if he’s really helping the youth by breaking down racial barriers and showing a productive outlet for anger and other feelings through art.\n\n‘Latter’ is also a homophone of ‘ladder’, as he could the latter mentioned option, or he could be ‘the ladder’, a way to escape possibly from a hole one has been forced into.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today","annotation":"“Scapegoat” is a term used when someone or something is blamed for the wrongdoings and issues in the world, despite it not being their fault.\n\nHe is saying how he feels the media blames him for problems going on in the world like homophobia and violence, when he isn’t the cause of these issues.\n\nIt is easier to put the blame on one person for all the bad things going on than look at the topic as a whole and finding the real root of the issue.\n\n“Scapegoat” is a term that comes from the Bible:\n\nBut the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.\nLeviticus 16:10\n\nThe use of this word further ties in the religious wordplay and imagery he uses in the rest of this verse.","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me","annotation":"Eminem’s anti-Christian remarks fueled “Christian rapper” KJ-52’s song “Dear Slim”, modeled after Em’s “Stan”.

Ask yourself: who could be the “Playboy” he’s talking to here?\n\nIn the same vein, “Bruise too much, I lose too much” is Biggie’s way of saying that he gains nothing by fighting and going to war (think East Coast/West Coast beef).

However, in this case, we might assume that R. Kelly has an extensive sample size and is able to control for confounding variables (club quality, bottle quality, model quality, etc.) and therefore implying that the bottles are indeed leading to the models.\n\n\n\nNote: R. Kelly does not explicitly imply that there is a linear relationship between models and bottles. In all likelihood there are decreasing returns to scale: at some point, each incremental full bottle ordered will result in less than an full additional model fornicated with.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I take a chick to my room like caveman","annotation":"Now we know, Kellz.\nThis didn’t age well.","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"\"Skeet-skeet-skeet-skeet, weatherman 'bout to make it rain!\"","annotation":"The phrase “make it rain” has two definitions; one of which is the more common usage, and, “less explicit.” Here, R.

Young and restless\nWhere restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace\nAnd next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus\n\nSaying she couldn’t ‘afford’ a car could be a reference to ‘a Ford,’ which is another popular car brand.\n\nIn Donda West’s book, Raising Kanye, she notes that this line is both about a cousin of Kanye’s named Alexis, and the woman he was dating at the time, Alexis Phifer.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"She had hair so long that it looked like weave\n Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve","annotation":"Long hair has always been associated with beauty. Since she has grown it out to the point that it looks fake (weave), it ultimately defeats the purpose of growing it out in the first place.

How could you not be scared when you step out on that stage? How can I not be scared on the second album? How could I not be scared when I dropped “Diamonds” and there’s people who say, “I don’t like ‘Diamonds’ ”?\n\n\nBrooke Crittendon, who dated Kanye for 2 and a half years, described him as “insecure” and “vulnerable”.\n\nA Pasha is a luxury Cartier watch. Kanye feels he always has to wear expensive watches like Pashas or Rolexes in order to cover his insecurities. The fact that Kanye states “at least one of his watches” implies that he sometimes has more than one solely to validate him to himself and his friends.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!\n Then I spent four hundred bucks on this\n Just to be like, \"Nigga, you ain't up on this\"","annotation":"“Ver-say-see” is a mispronounciation of the luxury brand Versace (pronounced “ver-SACH-eh” [verˈsaːtʃe]). Kanye emphasises how “so insecure” he is: to the point he buys ridiculously expensive things he can’t even pronounce, just so he can (maybe) feel like the rich people who also wear them.\n\nIt’s also important to note that Kanye self-consciously re-establishes a hierarchy (“Just to be like ‘Nigga you ain’t up on this’”) based on materialistic values (the watches). Instead of helping the community, Kanye contributes to the legacy of colonial violence on African Americans. He is aware he is doing this but he can’t stop himself.\n\nKanye seems to be imitating a line from Joe Ezterhas'  movie Showgirls, where main character Nomi says “Thanks. It’s a Ver-sayce” after being complimented on her dress.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iM9Gav-G4c","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And I can't even go to the grocery store\n Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team","annotation":"While “Ones” could be in reference to Nike’s Air Force 1, it’s most likely alluding to another Nike model: the Jordan 1. In an interview with Sway, Kanye claimed: “The Jordans are only popular at this point because of two people: me and Don C. Because Don C was ordering them vintage Jordans when the 4s used to break apart on the sole.”\n\n\n\nYe was also an avid wearer of throwback jerseys. Maybe he’s alluding to the Nolan Ryan jersey he wore in his “Through the Wire” video.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"It seem we livin' the American Dream\n But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem","annotation":"The American Dream is to be wealthy and successful, but the people that seem to achieve the dream are often left unfulfilled, perhaps because of the things they had to sacrifice to get there or the meaninglessness of an existence defined by the things you own.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"The prettiest people do the ugliest things\n For the road to riches and diamond rings","annotation":"Some innocent (pretty) people will do low (ugly) things to obtain fame and fortune. The line takes a portion of the chorus to “Real Niggas” by The Notorious B.I.G.

And if you don’t floss, your teeth will deteriorate.\n\n“Flossing” can also mean exhibiting jewellery. Ye opines that African-Americans like to wear jewellery and show off money as a response to racism against them. Being flashy can help to heal a shattered self-esteem and it also sends a big “fuck you” to haters. The next verse expands on this theory in detail.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"We tryna buy back our 40 acres","annotation":"“40 acres and a mule” was the promise of compensation made to freed African American slaves after the Civil War.

The “a” in front of the word stoop not only fills out the length of this line, making it fit rhythmically better with the next, but also pre-emphasizes the message of the next line – to society at large, per Kanye’s view, any rich black man will be stereotyped as just some drug dealer who spends his time hanging out on a stoop.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe","annotation":"Even if a black person is successful in life and buys flashy things with the money they’ve earned, to the world at the end of the day to many they are just a “nigga in a coupe”.\n\nNote the usage of “coupe.” On the surface level it refers to an expensive car, but doubles as “coop” continuing the interwoven themes of internalized racism, external racism, and materialism that lead to the line in the middle of the following verse:\n\n“Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]","annotation":"Kanye gets Syleena Johnson to interpolate Lauryn Hill’s line from “The Mystery of Iniquity,” the line being:\n\nWhen it all, it all falls down, I’m telling you all, it all falls down\n\nKanye originally attempted to sample the recording but couldn’t obtain legal permission.

However, the more significant interpretation is that black people aren’t free from themselves because they are too focused on materialism, an idea that Kanye introduced in the last verse and expands on in the rest of this one.\n\nIt also important to note that the entirety of this song is about internalized racism, about internalized white supremacy. “Self-consciousness” is a term eerily similar to the internalized Panoptic gaze, Foucault discusses. So, while you may not be in physical in prison, internally you are because you have internalized the white supremacist gaze and act on it by being materialistic.

The line is no less true abiding by this interpretation; Nas' pen-work could be spotted a mile off.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway","annotation":"E&J Brandy is a relatively inexpensive liquor, and the fact that Nas mentions it here really says a lot about where he was when he wrote this.\n\n“Bent” means “drunk;” the slang is derived from the imagery of drunk people bent over, throwing up after a night of drinking.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs","annotation":"Cee-lo is a very popular three-dice game in the ghetto; $50 a roll is relatively high stakes for a game of street cee-lo, but still low-stakes enough to brandish Nas' street thug credentials\n\n“Grants” refers to the image of Ulysses S. Grant (18th US  president) on the US $50 note (one of the dead presidents mentioned elsewhere on Illmatic)","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps","annotation":"He laughs at crack addicts desperately trying to sell broken stereo amplifiers because they are desperate for money to buy crack (I mean, it is pretty funny…)\n\n“Baseheads” is slang for crack addict; they’re selling junk they may have stolen in their desperation for drug money. Of course “bass” ties into “amp”, so the wordplay here is pretty intricate.\n\n\n\nBase is also known to refer to high quality amphetamine (often shortened to “amp”). Thus, to feed their addiction, a base head would sell broken amps, or amphetamine that’s been cut after they already used some. So there’s speed-freaks trying to sell broken amps. Nice pun/dual-meaning with ‘base’ and ‘bass’.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped","annotation":"They sit around telling stories and laughing about the last time C.R.A.S.H (the Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums – often known as ‘The Task Force’) raided them looking for narcotics or other illegal items.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston","annotation":"Nas sardonically alludes to the political revolution advocated by 1960s/1970s Black Power groups and referenced by Gil Scott-Heron on “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised”. While the incident Nas is reminiscing about was a violent insurrection of sorts, it was a gang related response to a police drug raid (or an assault by thugs from other blocks), not a bona fide revolution\n\nTo “catch a body” is to murder someone (since now you’ve got a corpse to deal with)\n\nJay-Z later paid homage to this line in “Open Letter”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and\n I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin","annotation":"This section starts a more focused narrative; Nas is known for these “stream of consciousness” bits: he is ambushed by his enemies and runs towards his Mac which is on the grass (the Mac 10 is a fairly large semi automatic weapon. Pavements are not the best place to hide one). Alternatively, being “in the grass” might just be a metaphor for the gun being hidden or concealed.\n\nThe reference to grass paired with comparing himself to a cheetah makes his neighborhood seem like a savannah or other wild habitat where predators lurk about. This taps into a motif as old as hip hop itself.  The cheetah is the fastest running animal on Earth and also has its roots in Africa, just like the Afro-American poet.\n\n\n\nThe question of who Nas is shooting at is tough to sort out – who does the “they” in “they caught us off-guard” refer to? One possible antecedent is the Task Force, implying that Nas is shooting at cops.\n\nOn the other hand, in the next line Nas is shooting at “niggas”, not a typical way to describe New York’s predominantly-white police force. So he is referring to a battling a rival crew. He’s actually remembering an incident involving the same dudes who once caught them off guard and tellin what happened during that instance.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Picked the MAC up, told brothers \"Back up!\" — the MAC spit\n Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip","annotation":"Once he gets his gun, Nas warns his enemies to back up before he opens fire. One of the enemies tries to run, so Nas shoots him in his back.\n\nIn movies, gun shots are usually dramatized and so often times when a character is shot in the back, the actor overacts by pushing his chest outward and arching his back, then finally falling to the ground.\n\nAn example of this is Drake in Degrassi: https://youtu.be/bV-K9CTQHhY?t=25s","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look","annotation":"This could be interpreted a number of different ways:\n\n\nThere were female bystanders but Nas was too nervous to look out for them since he’s busy just firing indiscriminately.\nHis arm is shaking from the recoil of the weapon he couldn’t look to see if he hit one of the “screaming chicks” – or perhaps just from nerves","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Gave another squeeze, heard it click, \"Yo, my shit is stuck!\"\n Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger","annotation":"With his highly narrative-oriented lyrical style, Nas was one of the first rappers to incorporate quotes and dialogues into his verses–see the final verse of “One Love”, which is largely a dialogue.\n\nNote that as soon as Nas realizes his gun is jammed (Mac 10s are notoriously unreliable when not regularly cleaned and maintained) and he can’t shoot, he’s “in danger”–a subtle way of noting that in the projects of Queensbridge in the 90s, it was either shoot or be shot.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber","annotation":"When one round of ammunition fails to eject from the chamber it becomes jammed. This is known as a “stovepipe” or a “failure to eject (FTE)” jam. When another is loaded from the magazine into the already jammed chamber, it makes the problem worse until the firearm fails to get back into battery and fire. When this happens to someone wielding a firearm and they open the action to see if they can clear the jam, the sight of a “stovepipe” is typically the sight of “…3 bullets caught up in the chamber.” The stovepipe or failure to eject jam is one of the worst possible jams, especially in automatic firearms like the Mac-10.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby\n And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be","annotation":"Nas introduces another defining feature of urban warfare: there are innocents everywhere.  He flees (“jetting”) inside a project building and in the lobby, only to find that it’s filled with “children” – i.e., the enemies he’s battling with are young enough to be considered kids.\n\nThis can also be a double entendre, as Nas probably couldn’t even see clearly because he was so high.\n\nWord play – “jetting” and “couldn’t see as high as I be”, like he’s in the sky. This is an example of Nas’s beautiful, intricate rhymes. “building,” “children”; and “lobby,” “prob'ly,” “I be.”\n\nThere is also another double entendre, children aren’t as tall as adolescents/adults, so they naturally need to look up to see things while the taller people just can look straight ahead of them. So the children can’t see as high as an adolescent/adult/Nas.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"(So, what you sayin'?)","annotation":"An interruption indicates that his stream-of-consciousness story is over.\n\nThis phrase might well be in reference to EPMD’s “So Was Cha Sayin'”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"It's like the game ain't the same\n Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name","annotation":"When you sleep on the street\nLittle motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep\n\nThis line is reminiscent of the general sentiment in “Things Done Changed” from Biggie’s classic album Ready To Die, an unofficial sort of sister album that came out the same year as Illmatic. 1994 was a good year for hip hop.\n\nNas is upset that this new generation of young men engage in violence out of vanity, not as a last resort. Examples are in City of God and The Wire where kids killed some of the most respected guys that nobody could touch.\n\nThis line is an explicit reference to the previous line “it was full of children.” The thugs who were trying to kill him were just kids – hence Nas’s comments about “younger niggas pulling the triggers.”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And claim some corners,","annotation":"To “claim a corner” is to establish your control over a street corner as an outpost for selling drugs\n\nFights break out over this sort of thing; Nas – a peaceable man – would probably advocate a simple “first come, first served” rule","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Crews without guns are goners","annotation":"And I’m down with the shit, too, for the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu\nInstead of a MAC-10, he tried scrappin'\nSlugs in his back and that’s what the fuck happens\n\nYou can’t fight to gain control of/keep control of territory if you don’t have any firepower.

Klein and a young Shawn Carter ran together in the ‘80s selling crack cocaine. The line is referring to when Hov and Klein were arrested together while driving in the Brooklyn Don’s green BMW E34 sedan.\n\n\n\nIn 1989 they were at a house party in Maryland when a fight broke out between their crew and the hosts. They were arrested and charged with attempted murder, attempted murder to maim, battery assault, and possession of a deadly weapon.\n\nKlein paid the victim $50,000 in return for him dropping the charges on one of the two. Klein already had prior attempted murder convictions, so Jay offered to take the charges and stand trial in his place. Luckily for us, Klein recognized Hov’s rap potential and took the weight of the case. Hov was acquitted and released. He would later testify on Klein’s behalf and help his 40-year sentence be reduced to four years.\n\n\n\nAfter being released on drug convictions in 2004 Klein claimed that Hov embellished his past in his raps:\n\nI give him 10% of his life that he talked about. He is from Brooklyn, he lived in Marcy Projects, his name is Shawn Carter, he got that right. Calvin Klein, a Brooklyn Don, my legacy speaks for itself. Jay had to take parts of that in order to be who he is.\n\nLater, in a 2014 interview with Complex, Klein recanted on his earlier statements:\n\nYou have to kind of look at his history. How many times have you caught him in a lie? You have to give him the benefit of the doubt … Was Jay-Z a good hustler? I’m a hell of a hustler too, but he’s a hell of a hustler.

Essentially, Jada is asking “if we friends, why do you arm yourself to come kick it with me?”\n\nThe reality of it is that this friend, “daddy”, feels he still can’t really trust Jada; and this makes Jada feel like he can’t trust him.

Why'd he kiss that whore?\n Why?!","annotation":"In July 2003, about a year before Jadakiss released this song, NBA superstar Kobe Bryant was arrested in connection with the sexual assault of a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but denied rape accusations—although he did later issue an apology wherein he acknowledged he understood how she “[felt] she did not consent”:\n\nAfter months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.\n\nHere, though, Jada seems less concerned with the well-being of the accuser and the facts of the case—instead, he cares about how the accusations affected Bryant’s basketball career.\n\nAlthough the case was ultimately dropped because Bryant’s accuser refused to testify, it continued to damage his reputation, even popping back into the media spotlight over a decade-and-a-half later in a Washington Post article following his win at the 2018 Oscars for his animated short “Dear Basketball.”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why did Bush knock down the towers?","annotation":"Jadakiss apparently believes Bush was responsible for 9/11.

See Corr. Law §803(1)(c)\n\nAs a result, the default is that people on determinate sentences only serve 6/7 of the time they’re sentenced to (and 6/7=.857 or 85% rounding down).  So if you behave in prison you do 85% of your time (which, as Jadakiss points out, is still a lot and still really sucks!)","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And why do niggas lie in 85% of they rhymes?","annotation":"There are certain rappers nowadays that rap about what they don’t live, or what they don’t have.

The second line criticizes the political apathy that made this travesty possible.\n\nActual Terminators seized power in a coup d'etat","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why I sell in the stores what you could sell in the streets?","annotation":"A reference to his low commercial sales; he’s only selling as many albums as he could sell via street mixtapes\n\nHe’s frustrated because one major advantage of signing to a record label is to get promotion to boost sales, but that doesn’t seem to actually be happening.  Also, rappers make more money per mixtape CD sold than per commercially released CD, so Jadakiss is probably losing money under his record deal\n\nThis could also be a double meaning, hinting that he’s selling dope music like dealers sell dope on the streets.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why I say the hottest shit but be sellin' the least? why","annotation":"Jada and his crew, The Lox, are not as commercially successful as he thinks they should be","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Verse 3: Jadakiss]","annotation":"Apparently, ‘Kiss has gotten a bit wiser as the song went by, because in the third verse he can finally answer some of his questions:\n\n“Why rap? ‘Cause I need air time”\n\n“Why all the young niggas is dyin'? ‘Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' with iron”\n\n“And you know why they made the new twenties?\n‘Cause I got all the old ones—that’s why!”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar?","annotation":"Halle Berry didn’t win an Oscar until Monster’s Ball, in which she has a graphic sex scene with Billy Bob Thornton:\n\n\n\nIncidentally, her character’s dead husband is played by Puff Daddy, who Jada hates, so maybe that influenced his perception of the movie","status":"verified"},{"text":"Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?","annotation":"Although Denzel won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in “Glory” (1989), he didn’t win for Best Actor until “Training Day,” – in which he plays a crooked cop – which was nowhere near his best performance.

He became the second African-American to win the award, after Sidney Poitier’s 1963 win for “Lillies of the Field” (nowhere near his best performance, either).\n\nJadakiss is pointing out that blacks in the industry can get awards only if they either subjugate themselves to whites (by getting fucked), or conform to stereotypes (by playing criminals)","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why they didn't make the CL6 with a clutch?","annotation":"Why isn’t there a version of the Mercedes Benz CL600 with a manual transmission?","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And if you don't smoke\n Then why the hell you reachin' for my dutch?!","annotation":"If you don’t smoke, why are you reaching for my blunt (Dutches are Dutch Masters, used for rolling blunts)?\n\n(Probably because you told Jada you don’t smoke, but changed your mind when you smelled the potency of what he was rolling)","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why all the young niggas is dyin'?\n ‘Cause they moms at work\n They pops is gone,","annotation":"A lot of kids go without fathers, forcing the mother to compensate, which means they have to work more to support the household.

This is consonant with his 9/11 Trutherism.\n\nA more charitable explanation is that Jada is suggesting that the government has not adequately invested in AIDS research because it affects mostly marginal communities (blacks and gays), which would have been a defensible point until the late 1990s.","status":"verified"},{"text":"Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days?","annotation":"Jadakiss' product is so awesome that fiends fall out after shooting it up right after copping.\n\nDiesel refers to high potency “gray uncut diesel” heroin.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Why you screamin' like it's a slug?

The idea being that, though the world is a confusing place, one thing is clear: Jadakiss has a lot of money\n\nOld twenty:\n\n\n\nNew twenty:\n\n\n\nIf you like the old ones, Jada is selling some of his vintage $20 bills for $25 on his website.","status":"verified"}]},{"lyrics":"[Intro: Raekwon]\nYeah\nOne-two\n(You got that?)\nYeah, let's go\nSilent King\nYeah\nThe big park shit\nYou know how it go\nIn them alleys\n(I'ma holler at you, though)\n\n[Verse 1: Raekwon]\nSince rap got locked right before we visit the '90s\nChef in the kitchen, cooking up with the crimeys\nIt's late fall, dime season\nWe bought the crib next to Bill Clinton' mother\n'Cause she fuck with the Chinese\nThey hitting niggas with hero'n'\nIt's fourteen of us with beamers\nWe won't stop pitching the Chevron\nIt's packed, kid, Black kids don't know how to act\nThey flashing Macs, Gillettes, a couple of stacks, yo\nThe systems is -upid\nYup, shorty with the pumps on\nAnd dunks get provided and scooped, kid\nAnd bloodhounds is hating, they knowing how the kid get down\nSilent shottys with grenades, I'm waiting\nAnd everybody love vintage\nYou see like four, five niggas with half-moons and wave intentions\n\"What's really good?\"\n\"The 'dro hit 'em, killed 'em in the hotel\nHeard he had some old chick with him\"\n\n[Hook: Raekwon & Ghostface Killah]\nThat's how we make it happen, that's how we break it down\nHood all day, nigga, watch how we take the town\nThat's why we do the do, just know who is who\nAcknowledge me all day (Yo!), and understand Wu is Wu\n\n[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]\nBut on the other side of town, it's Tony, laid up (Ugh)\nThis white chick want to gargle my nuts\nI put the Bailey's down, tap the blunt out\nGrabbed her by her hair, watch blondie-love whip my dick out\nSpit dripping down my balls, she slobbing me\n\"That's right!

Ray Benzino, who was trying to destroy Eminem’s career at the time, said:\n\n“Don’t make this right now a double standard. We gotta treat this the same way you treat Mike Tyson, like you treat Kobe Bryant, like you treat R. Kelly, like you treat O.J.

It is right on the border of the city of Detroit.  He and his mother moved from Warren to the east side of Detroit (the house made famous on his album covers) when he was 12; in his book The Way I Am he said he continued going to school in Warren so he could be with his friends.

But Em gets his back by telling the  full story with all the fine details Benzino could never get, explaining the hugely racial divide in his childhood and the settings that lead to the racist tape being made.\n\nThis could also be referring to Chaos Kid (An old friend of Em’s) telling MTV that him and Em were trying to be as “wack as possible.”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"You have well informed me, I am well-aware\n That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear","annotation":"This applies to both music and location.\n\nGrowing up, some black people didn’t like seeing Eminem in certain “black” areas, as he details in the next lines.\n\nAnd musically, one of the typical reactions to Em being white and rapping was, as he recounted for Rolling Stone:\n\nMotherfuckers was like, ‘You’re a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for?

I flipped them off back, they drove away, and I didn’t think nothin' of it.” Evidently they parked the car. “One dude came up, hit me in the face and knocked me down. Then he pulled out a gun. I ran right out of my shoes, dog. I thought that’s what they wanted.” But they didn’t — when Mathers returned the next day, his shoes were still stuck in the mud. “That’s how I knew it was racial.” Em was saved by a white guy who pulled over, took out a gun and drove him home.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"From the black side all the way to the white side","annotation":"Although it’s typical for big metropolitan cities in the U.S. to present a racial divide within neighborhoods, Detroit — the city where Eminem grew up — constitutes an extraordinary case when it comes to this matter.

From these lines we learn that that same year they’d already broken up for the first time, which led Eminem to date another girl, who was African-American. Their relationship, however, didn’t last long and the day they broke up Eminem went on to record his highly racist “Ole Foolish Pride”. As he explained to Rolling Stones in 2004:\n\nThis is what we used to do. I’d go in my man’s basement and do goofy freestyles, and we’d call ‘em sucker rhymes, and the whole point of the rap was to be as wack as possible and warm up before we actually did songs that we wrote.

The tape was filled with many racial slurs towards African-American girls in general, and Eminem apologized for its content shortly after the track was leaked:\n\nThe tape they played today was something I made out of anger, stupidity and frustration when I was a teenager. I’d just broken up with my girlfriend, who was African-American, and I reacted like the angry, stupid kid I was. I hope people will take it for the foolishness that it was, not for what somebody is trying to make it into today.\n\nAnd again in another statement a few days later:\n\nSo while I think common sense tells you not to judge a man by what he may have said when he was a boy, I will say it straight up: I am sorry I said those things when I was 16. And I don’t want to let anybody turn this into an opportunity to promote their own bullsh—agenda.\n\nHere he intends to apologize a third time. In particular, he apologizes for the “black girls are bitches” line he had rapped on “Ole Foolish Pride”, but does it sarcastically as he’s not taking back the insult, but rather extending it to all girls, regardless of color. The delivery is subtle as he doesn’t actually pronounce “ho”, but makes it obvious that’s what’s supposed to rhyme with “wrong” on the line above.\n\nThe discovery and release of the two songs by The Source was not an isolated shot at Eminem’s career, but part of an ongoing beef between Eminem and Ray Benzino, one of the owners of The Source at the time. This beef is the main topic of the next song on the album, “Like Toy Soldiers”.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road","annotation":"The railroad tracks are being compared to the the yellow brick road in the Wizard of Oz; to get to Oz, all you have to do is follow the yellow brick road.\n\n\n\nEminem walked the railroads to go to the hip-hop clubs in order to pursue his dreams of making it in rap.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road","annotation":"The railroad tracks are being compared to the the yellow brick road in the Wizard of Oz; to get to Oz, all you have to do is follow the yellow brick road.\n\n\n\nEminem walked the railroads to go to the hip-hop clubs in order to pursue his dreams of making it in rap.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Outro: Debbie Mathers]\n Fuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!\n Get the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!\n You son of a bitch!","annotation":"Considering that Eminem rapped the following in the second verse of this song:\n\nTo meet Kim had to walk\nBack to her mama’s on Chalmers after dark\nTo sneak me in the house when I’m kicked out my mom’s\n\nit’s very likely that the woman yelling in the background while the song is fading out is meant to be Eminem’s mother, Debbie Mathers-Briggs, in one of the many times she kicked him out of the house. As he detailed on the interview for Anthony Bozza’s Whatever You Say I Am:\n\nI stayed with my mom until I was eighteen, but I kept getting kicked out. I was only there full-time really when I was thirteen and fourteen. My mother did a lot of fucking dope and shit, so she had mood swings. She took a lot of pills. She took two or three naps a day. She’d go to sleep cool and wake up and start yelling, ‘What the fuck’s wrong with this fucking house? This house is a fucking mess! Motherfucker, get the fuck out!’ My room was upstairs, so she’d come up and throw open the door and flip on me. I used to record her. I’ve got those tapes somewhere. I’d play them for my grandmother. She’s actually my great-grandmother — my mother’s grandmother. Those two never got along, but I liked her. I used to go over there when my mother would kick me out. She’s real old now, like ninety-two, I think.\n\nSo, given the existence of these tapes, there’s also a good chance that this background yelling is a recording of Debbie’s actual voice, rather than a simple reenactment of her kicking him out.","status":"accepted"}]},{"lyrics":"[Intro]\n“Street Science, you’re on the air.

Pac contrarily shows his empathy for the streets as opposed to the “Hit ‘Em Up” lyrics being paraphrased by the interviewer. Although Tupac is recognized for his duality of being both the boisterous, indignant, black revolutionary and the soft spoken, poetic, humanitarian it is ultimately his ability to paint a chilling mosaic of the deplorable condition of his people that has truly solidified his martyr legacy. In this verse Tupac genuinely portrays the struggle of the  daily “hustle”  to the listener.  The chase for currency, the seemingly universal hard times, worrying faces, and the black on black holocaust that continues to affect America today.  Even in 1996 the idea of burying friends who were “close to the heart” had became an all to prevalent conditioned reality. It is lyrical contributions such as this that make Tupac not only a hero to the community but truly a one of a kind human being.

He didn’t stab any of his victims though and targeted couples rather than women specifically.\nThe Phantom, a comic book superhero from the fictional African country of Bangalia. He has guns for weapons rather than knives though. And he’s married so presumably only ‘stabbing’ the one woman.\n\n\n\nWe’re going with Phantom of the Opera.

But that didn’t stop him from rapping about it. Knowing the popularity and love for all things marijuana in the genre, J. Cole admitted that he kept rapping about weed to keep his fans interested.\n\nIt’s a stereotype that all rappers smoke weed, especially when the fathers of Hip Hop music were looked up to for the amount of marijuana they smoked. During the start of the booming Hip Hop industry in 1988 a span of legendary albums were dropped during the summer of that year. This included, but was not limited to, Run-D.M.C.’s Tougher Than Leather, EPMD’s Strictly Business, Public Enemy‘s It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Eric B. & Rakim‘s Follow the Leader, Salt-n-Pepa’s A Salt With a Deadly Pepa, 2 Live Crew’s Move Somethin’, Ice-T’s Power, and both Eazy-E’s Eazy-Duz-It and N.W.A‘s Straight Outta Compton, etc. The marijuana use increased as it came to light through rap.","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"Whole style obviously copied, pasted","annotation":"Computer wordplay.

Still, he devil-advocates, if he applied himself he could be a better man. Maybe, but it’s hard when there is a liquor store on every corner in your neighborhood and the cops (“twelve”) harass you constantly: why not just give up (alcoholism) or play your assigned role (criminal)?\n\n“Only god can judge me” is a rap cliche. So Pill is taking a rather traditional line at the end of the song by explaining himself to God. Or is he? Typically “only god can judge me” has been invoked by rappers to avoid explaining themselves. But this whole song is an explanation: circumstances prevent Pill from escaping his moral dilemma. By spending so much breath justifying not his thug but his humanity we have to wonder if Pill cares as much about judgment on earth as in heaven","status":"accepted"}]},{"lyrics":"[Intro]\n\"That was the warm up, that was the warm up, baby\nAight, Elite, for real, one take, dawg, and I'm up outta here\nOne, yup, yeah.\"\n\n[Verse]\nLord, please forgive me for my sinning\nI ain’t saying that I’m finished, but I’m praying in advance\nCause the way her eyes glance like they playing in my pants\nYeah, ball game\nI swear the hoes wasn’t in my plans when a nigga took the chance and came to the big city\nMy beat machine the only fucking thing I had with me\nLike Bobby had Whitney, we was cooking up crack\nBut them fifteen credits had a nigga off track\nPicture that, best rapper since Lil Wayne in classes\nThe best bachelor since Bruce Wayne with his bachelor’s\nBut mastered this rap shit\nYou hear the words coming from my lips bastards\nI never crack, I got that Chapstick\nI practiced till that shit made perfect and served it to the people on a silver platter\nNow where’s the ladder?\nCause either you gonna whine or you climb; I chose the latter\nKnow you haters is pissed, hold your bladder though\n‘Fore you get tossed like a forward lateral\nWe never tattle, let God handle that\nOr let the mob handle that\nNo Soprano, half black, half white; I’m a piano\nI’m an animal, my video on Discovery Channel\nI’m a beast when my shit hits the streets, these niggas cease to exist\nLike a beach in a tsunami,  you'll find me in the ‘Ville\nIn the state of NC\nBitch, if I ain’t back home, I’m up in NYC\n‘Bout that money prob-ly like a fucking robbery\nBut I ain’t jacking\nI’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking\nI’m chasing dreams sort of like jeans, boy, I ain’t slacking\nHey, take a hard look at my drive nigga, no hacking on my shit\nI’m straight smacking niggas, straight tagging niggas\nYo, I freestyle and fuck you niggas, ya’ll be wilding and I’m out","tags":["Rap","Jazz Rap"],"title":{"name":"Just to Get By","id":119},"artist":{"name":"J.

First off, they could be driving around searching for dealer to hook them up with some weed, as the duo was known to puff the magic dragon back in the day. Alternatively, they could be riding all around town trying to find someone to give their music a chance.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)\n Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals\n Had my pencil, and plus, my paper","annotation":"André locks himself in his recording studio, stares up at the ceiling while listening to beats (aka “instrumentals”), and waits for inspiration to strike so he can write those thoughts in his rhyme book. Dre might also be looking up to the ceiling/sky in hopes that God helps him out. He has claimed that God speaks to the masses through his rhymes on this record, so it’s plausible.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur","annotation":"Big Boi and Dre rode the 86 Lithonia/ 86 L bus into Decatur, an Atlanta suburb with a fairly sizable black population. It’s one of the hoods the duo frequently reps in their lyrics, see their song “Decatur Psalm” for an example.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also historical significance behind Decatur that influences the meaning here. It has always been divided by Memorial Drive into a “black” and a “white” side. On the Northeast side is “white Decatur”, filled with prosperous white churches and high quality schools and hospitals (including Dekalb Medical Center). On the other side is “black Decatur”, which extends from Candler Road, Glenwood Road, and Snapfinger Road all the way down to Rainbow Drive. Historically, this side has more of a hood reputation, and is filled with flea markets, prostitution, nightclubs, liquor stores, and one of Atlanta’s most “ghetto malls”: South Dekalb.\n\nTaking the 86L will take you from Lithonia into the black part of Decatur, specifically the East Lake train station. Though it has since been gentrified and now has high property values, the area of East Lake used to be a notorious government housing project called “Lil Vietnam” and accounted for many murders and violence in the 80s and 90s. It is in this transition state between the hood and the nicer parts of Atlanta that OutKast writes these lyrics.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light\n Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock","annotation":"André plays on the word “spotlight”, a symbol for fame, to describe his early attempts to make it big. He and Big Boi used to go on stage and try to “light it up” (do really well), so that they would have a chance to make it into the spotlight as up-and-coming rappers.\n\nAndre 3000 also might want to find his spot in the world by writing rhymes, and want to to stand out (light off) in that spot which could be Decatur and/or Atlanta.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop\n Like, \"Freeze!\" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no","annotation":"“Hole in the wall clubs” are small, off-the-beaten-path places where aspiring performers can play. They get experience, but not notoriety and money.\n\nThe Hole in the Wall is a popular club in Atlanta, and the duo was able to make the crowd move with their awesome music when they performed there, but only performing at local clubs doesn’t bring in much money. André and Big Boi aspire to perform on a national stage, and thus have to stop what they are doing and reevaluate their lives, similar to how everyone on the dance floor in a club stops dancing when someone yells “Freeze!”\n\n\n\nThis is also a reference to the late 80’s and early 90’s under-the-radar Atlanta rap act Success-n-Effect, one of the first political hip-hop groups. They had minor success with the single “The Freeze”, but never achieved financial success despite making a good buzz in the ATL. OutKast knows that they have to take measures to make sure this doesn’t happen to them.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Check it, a-one-two, a-one\n \"Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,\" they call us","annotation":"“One-two one-two” is a classic mic check that many rappers (such as Lupe Fiasco) imitate to start off their verses.

During the crack epidemic of the 80’s, crack cocaine elevated the gang violence in the United States, putting the issue of gang banging on the map.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Niggas say, \"Motherfuck that playin',\" they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals","annotation":"Outkast has done too much and come from a too rough of a neighborhood to give up on the chance that has come from their music.\n\nThey aren’t “playing” around, because someone’s finally “paying” them money, so they will be “staying” true to their craft.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"\"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise\"\n Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly\n '96 gon' be that year that all y'all player-haters can bite me\n I'm out this bitch","annotation":"Despite the fact that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik went platinum, there were many people that viewed the duo as a gimmick that would not have any staying power in this industry.

Once he figured this out he began smoking blunts.

By stating that he now earns Euros, Jay-Z’d be indicating that he now accepts multiple forms of currency.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"It's my go, yeah","annotation":"This kind of sounds like “ It’s Michael”, Wayne’s middle name.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Off the richter,","annotation":"The Richter scale is used to measure the intensity of earthquakes.\n\n\n\nWayne is saying here his rhymes are more intense than even the most devastating quake","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage","annotation":"Wayne is running the names of boxer Hector “Macho” Camacho and wrestler “The Macho Man” Randy Savage… together.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I know, I ride slow, and when I pass","annotation":"Weezy alludes to the way he likes to ride in Jody Breeze’s song “Dippin' (Catch Me If You Can)”:\n\nI’m coming around the loop\nI’m in the Bentley Coupe\nIn the 35 doing 22\nDon’t honk your horn, don’t flash your lights\nCause me and Jody passing blunts like we pass the mic","status":"accepted"},{"text":"They say, \"What up, killa?\" Man, stop bringin' up my past","annotation":"When Wayne passes by, they holler “what up, killa?” in a casual sense, “killa” holding a similar connotation to “bro”, “homie”, etc. However, in Wayne’s response,  “stop bringing up my past”, he insinuates that he really was a killer.
