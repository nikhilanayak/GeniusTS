So when we come to the table to gamble, it’s with our very lives.\n\n—Jay-Z, Decoded","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Verse 1]","annotation":"This track was originally meant to be a collaboration between Jay, a member of the group Original Flavor, and Nas—but when producer Ski Beatz heard this first verse they gave the song to Hov to record by himself.\n\nWhat happened was, I was doing that song with someone else, and they heard the first verse and they was like, ‘Man, you take that song. Finish it, 'cause it sounds like you got a lot more to say.’","status":"accepted"},{"text":"While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely\n My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me","annotation":"This opening couplet is one of Jay’s most iconic, and has two possible meanings:\n\n\nDrug dealer – his enemies are watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake. Since his drugs (“shit”) make him a lot of money (“butter for the bread”), they want to kill him (continuing the carbs metaphor – “toast” him). Jay subtly lets us know that he is on top of the drug game–he is aware that people are out to get him, and is keeping tabs on the people who are keeping tabs on him, effectively turning the hunter into the hunted.\nRapper – he’s on stage, his fans are watching him at a concert (or otherwise keeping track of his song releases). His music (“shit”) makes him money, and his fans want to “toast” (honour) him.\n\n\n\nIn Decoded he said:\n\nIn this line, I turn a noun, bread (meaning “money”) into a verb, toast (meaning “shoot”), which draws out the relationship between money and danger.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be\n Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet","annotation":"His brain and his penis, both of which could lead him down dangerous path’s if he keeps them unchecked.\n\nRelationships are more complicated for those involved in the hustle: You never know if the girl you’re with isn’t just a decoy that your enemies use to get you into a vulnerable position (or may cause trouble for you because she was involved with another hustler before you that might catch feelings).\n\nJay has explored the topic regularly over the years, most notably in “D'Evils,” during the second verse when he uses an enemies girl to smoke him out and extract retribution.\n\nNote the wordplay with “track” and “feet,” and “clapped,” all having roots in sport (running the track in front of an audience).","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away","annotation":"From Decoded:\n\nSleeplessness, weariness, and adrenaline are symptoms of paranoia, of engaging in illegal activity in plain sight. “Four fiends away” indicates the distance between me and the street-level action. The implication is that I’m a boss, to some degree buffered from low-level workers who can be easily urged to cooperate with authorities.\n\nA similar situation was described in “Coming of Age”:\n\nlife could be better\nLike my man reclined in plush leather seats\nHe’s selling weight, I’m selling eight balls\n\nMemphis Bleek is explaining this exact line, but from a different perspective. He’s the the “brother” admiring Jay from four fiends away.","status":"unreviewed"},{"text":"My pain, wish it was quick to see\n From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee","annotation":"A “fricassee” is a meal of diced or minced meat. Outwardly, Jay appears calm and at ease, but his brain is turned to mush from the anxiety and paranoia he experiences daily in his chosen profession.\n\nIt’s another example of Jay equating selling drugs to taking them. The way drugs scramble a fiends brains is equal to that of the stress a hustler deals with.\n\n“Fried to a fricassee” may have inspired this Cam'ron line.\n\n\n\nA better tasting fricassee","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me\n At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly\n My squad and me lack of respect for authority\n Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief","annotation":"This is a time to look back, to reminisce on his earlier days. The thrill was more important than the pain. As he said in Decoded:\n\nThe rewards – the money, the girls, the excitement… I wanted to tell stories and boast, to entertain and to dazzle… Balled ridiculously in Vegas, I went dead broke and got hood rich on those streets.\n\nJay’s “squad” was his drug-dealing crew, and the key is “escaping poverty.” During “Money, Cash, Hoes” he explained:\n\nYea I rap now, fast money, dun slowed up\n\nThe fast money on the streets is just that: fast. It comes and it goes, but when you’re living in the moment and not worrying about the consequences it can be beautiful.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"I know this game got valleys and peaks","annotation":"Another example of Jay’s premise on Reasonable Doubt, to explain both the good and the bad (or the gift and the curse) of selling drugs. It can also be flipped into commentary on the drug game, and you could argue Jay was in one of his only valleys when he released this record.\n\nAs Jay said on “Dead Presidents”:\n\nI’m here to tell n—s it ain’t all swell\nThere’s heaven, and then there’s hell n—s\nOne day you’re cruising in your 7, next day you’re sweating, forgetting your lies","status":"verified"},{"text":"Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly\n The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in","annotation":"This may be directly influenced by a story Jay told in Decoded (page 90):\n\nOne day at the end of school I got arrested by the school cop for trespassing; I had crack in my pockets, but since it was my first arrest and I had no prior offenses, they released me on my own recognizance. But the damage was done – They confiscated the work I was holding. Suddenly we were in a hole… When we got back, we worked even harder, determined to never be in a position where a loss would set us that far back.\n\nHe also addresses it in “A Week Ago”:\n\nTold you put away some cheddar now you crying for bail\nSeventeen and I’m holding on to around a mill\nI could bail out and blow trial and come around on appeal","status":"accepted"},{"text":"No more Big Willie, my game has grown\n Prefer you call me William","annotation":"Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money’s too young\nSee me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up\n\n“Big Willie” is slang for a street cat who is making big money and living large. Jay feels he has outgrown this group of people he once admired, as he has graduated from making his money through illegal drug dealing to becoming a legitimate businessman.\n\nFrom wanting to be a “Big Willie,”\n\n\n\nTo becoming “William:”","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like\n Channel 7 News,","annotation":"Rayful Edmond is the notorious drug dealer who introduced crack into the D.C. area in the ‘80s.\n\n\n\nIn Decoded Jay notes that Edmond once appeared on the news getting out of his own helicopter.\n\nIn an interview with Juan Epstein, {TIMESTAMP NEEDED} engineer Young Guru said that this reference was what intrigued him enough to start his collaborative relationship with Jay Z.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Round seven jewels,","annotation":"In Jay-Z’s book, Decoded  he cites this line as “round seven jewels.” (page 106).\n\nJewels also makes sense because at the time, Rayful Edmond was the face of hustlers' wealth and street bourgeois.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Head dead in the mic\n Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia\n \"I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.\"","annotation":"He is conveniently feigning amnesia, telling the police that “he doesn’t remember” in response to questioning about his drug business\n\nBy asking for his lawyer, he is also invoking his 5th Amendment Miranda rights, which demonstrates his familiarity with criminal procedure.\n\nAt the time, Jay’s lawyer was none other than Combat Jack, Reggie Ossé.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Lock my body, can't trap my mind","annotation":"There’s a triple meaning to this line. First, Jay speaks on being physically locked up in jail. He revisited this very line on his tribute to Emory Jones, “Do U Wanna Ride?”\n\nThey caught your body they can’t trap your mind\nKeep your spirit alive read your books\nMatter of fact, let me take you somewhere\nVibe with me, c'mon\n\nIt also refers to the crack game he’s stuck in. During his long nights selling drugs, he would right rhymes as a form of escapism, so even though he feels locked into the hustlers way of life, he’s still mentally free.\n\nFinally, it refers to the poverty that project housing enforces upon it’s occupants. He also tackled this topic on “Do U Wanna Ride?”\n\nYou know why they call The Projects a project, because it’s a project!\nAn experiment, we’re in it, only as objects\nAnd the object for us to explore our prospects\nAnd sidestep cops on the way to the top – yes!\nAs kids we would daydream, sittin on our steps\nPointin at cars like yeah that’s our sex\nHustlers profits made our eyes stretch","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Easily explain why we adapt to crime\n I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it","annotation":"This line resonates deeply with my listeners. It’s a take on the “Live Free or Die Trying,” “Liberty or Death” spirit that’s woven into the fabric of what it means to be American. But it’s also about great ambition, and the alternative, which is stagnation. The risk is death, so the reward should have equal gravity, a life lived to the fullest.\n\n— Jay-Z, in Decoded\n\n\n\nKendrick Lamar might have alluded to these lines on “M.A.A.D. City”:\n\nWe adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it\n Presidential suites my residential for the weekend","annotation":"He bet (I’m guessing the cash-equivalent of) a trip to Maui on the main event (of a boxing match)\n\n“The main event” refers to the reward, the spoils, and literally, a fight in Vegas. But main event could mean life as much as it means a staged fight. Presidential suites is that Big Willy is grown up – call him William.\n— Jay-Z, Decoded.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental","annotation":"The car he’s rented for his little weekend getaway is an Acura NSX (rice rocket – but impressive)\n\n\n\nDriving rental cars is a recurring theme in raps about selling crack, since it was a smart way for dealers not to be tracked when moving around the city\n\nThe way “NSX” is pronounced also sounds like “in excess”, which is a clever play on the lavish lifestyle as a hustler Jay espouses on this track.\n\nBut he also advises his adversaries, or anyone else, not to be fooled- based on the flash that he shows; he is both substance and style.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables\n Meet me by the one that starts a G up\n This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up","annotation":"During his Rap Radar Podcast episode, Kareem Burke shed some light on this line, explaining that the scene from the “Dead Presidents” video in which they’re playing monopoly features real money (“200 or something thousand dollars”),  and unopened bottles of Cristal to prove they were really living that life (no Fraud Willies present).\n\n\n\nBiggs also explained this line was born during a trip to Vegas in 1995, saying that Emory Jones received his nickname “Vegas” at the craps table during the Tyson vs McNeely fight:\n\nProbably around in about ’95 and we went to the first Tyson fight when he just came home from jail to fight McNeeley and that’s actually where the song “Can I Live”  came from. And that’s where Emory got his name Vegas, Vegas Jones, during that same trip. That’s where the line started getting a lot of notoriety at that time and Jay would put it in songs after that.\n\n\n\nThey stayed at the MGM Grand, the same hotel where the fight was held on August 19, 1995. Emory spent most of the week gambling; and at one point he was $20,000 up at the crap tables, meaning the whole trip became “free” for the Roc-A-Fella crew.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas","annotation":"Between margaritas and Mai Tais, Jay is drinking plenty of cocktails!","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Can I live?\n Can I live?","annotation":"A simple question, but what’s the answer?\n\nThroughout his whole life Jay has been hustling to make the money he needs to get out of the hood. He’s wondering if he can continue to live despite all of the stresses of life and seeing people get shot, overdose, and living in poverty every day.\n\nNot only that, but all that money he made in the drug game was just for living off of, but the government is trying to take it away, why won’t they just leave him alone and let him live his life?\n\nWell, it’s almost two decades later and it looks like the answer is yes, as Jay is living just fine:","status":"accepted"},{"text":"[Verse 2]","annotation":"Jay-Z has identified this verse as the last verse he ever wrote down, and the track’s producer suggests Nas nearly ended up with this verse.\n\nAs Hov told MTV:\n\nWhat happened was, I was doing that song with someone else, and they heard the first verse and they was like, ‘Man, you take that song. Finish it, ’cause it sounds like you got a lot more to say,’ ” Jay explained in a lengthy interview in which he discussed lyrics and songwriting. “You know, that type of thing. So I just wanted to get it down quick, I didn’t want to keep going over it. It was like [the album’s] mastering time, so I just sat down in the booth and wrote that [verse].”\n\nPer Irv Gotti in the August 2006 issue of XXL:\n\nJay actually wanted Nas on it. He just did one verse, and we was leavin' the second verse for Nas. But the Nas thing didn’t happen. So we came back in, and he did the second verse.\n\nAnd here’s more, from MTV in 2007:\n\n\nAccording to Irv Gotti, who produced the track, the song was supposed to be a collaboration between Jay and a member of the rap group Original Flavor. Gotti mentioned he believed Nas was also set to appear on the track. But after the OF member passed on the guest appearance, Jay got to work finishing the song.\n\nFrom what I remember, he actually didn’t write the full verse,” Gotti wrote in an e-mail to MTV News. “But since the verse was so long, he wrote a few words down, and that made him remember the whole verse.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle","annotation":"This is about the the interior of my mind. Constantly checking thoughts, separating what’s real from what’s fear and paranoia, what’s a part of the plan and what’s reckless.

Much like Jay’s mind.\n\n\n\nHe is also referring to the circle that wraps around the “L” in the Lexus logo; the sick thoughts are the circle, wrapping around this Luxurious but dangerous Life (the L) that, if steered wrong, will lead to certain doom.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"Platinum Rolex'd it","annotation":"A “Masterpiece.”\n\nFollowing this line when Jay says “You guessed it, manifested in tangible goods”, he was referring to how the “atrocities” that he and his crew were committing were manifested in material (tangible goods,) such as platinum Rolexes..","status":"accepted"},{"text":"We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should","annotation":"Hov officially retracted this advice in Decoded, writing:\n\nAdvising to buy a car rather than lease one speaks to my naïveté at the time. Cars lose value the minute they leave the lot.\n\nIn the August 2006 issue of XXL, Dame Dash says:\n\nBiggs [Kareem Burke, fellow Roc-A-Fella co-owner with Jay and Dame] came up with that line, “We don’t lease, we buy the whole car.” It was like a collaboration. At the time, Jay was like the ambassador of our life, of our movement. He was the spokesperson for everything that we were doing.\n\nAsk any accountant and they will tell you leasing is the way to go. It’s up to a 100% tax deductible right off especially if you lease through your business. In these days cars lose value so rapidly and only a small portion can be written off on buys. Obviously Jay-Z is explaining that he has illegal drug money so I doubt he pays much in taxes, but the real life Jay-Z could have leased the car instead and written it off through Roc-A-Fella records. Ended up with the tax write off and a new car in 3 years.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"My confederation, dead a nation\n Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient","annotation":"On the surface, Jay merely comments on a dream that his drug crew is going to rise to the highest echelon of money in America, basically overthrowing the establishment and the stigma that black people don’t amount to anything.\n\nHowever, when you look deeper, “confederation” alludes to the “Confederacy” in the Civil War, which like Jay’s crew tried to “dead a nation,” i.e. secede from the Union thus breaking up the country (incidentally, the Confederate States of America is a dead nation).  But the Confederacy was ultimately beaten by the Union.  And what’s more, it stood for a morally disgusting cause simply because it sustained the southern economy.\n\nThe Confederacy and Jay’s confederation are thus directly compared, forcing us to ask ourselves how similar or different they really are/were.\n\n“explode!/On detonation” can also apply to the nation Jay’s crew is trying to overthrow, or to Jay’s mind which earlier in the verse is depicted as “infested with sick thoughts” and is “dual levels.”\n\nAlso note the world play on the homophonic ‘dead-a-nation’ and ‘detonation’, and also Jay’s masterful use of internal rhyme: ‘confederation’, ‘dead a nation’, ‘detonation’, ‘said patient’.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"When it boils to steam, it comes to it\n We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this","annotation":"Hov echo this sentiment on “Public Service,”  rapping:\n\nHope you don’t think users are the only abusers\nNiggas getting high within the game\n\nHis explanation of that line in *Decoded is applicable here as well.\n\nAnd it’s not just the material spoils that keep you going: You start getting addicted to the thrill of it, the adrenaline rush of going to see your connect in a small building in Harlem in a lobby that you’ve never been in, where you go in with a bag of money and come out with a bag of work. Or the feeling when you come around the corner back home and all eyes turn to you because everyone knows who you are — you represent something successful and free and dangerous, all at once. You have the best car, the best jewelry, the whole package. You taste a strange kind of fame. It’s as addictive as the shit you’re selling, and just as deadly.\n\n—Jay-Z, Decoded (p31)\n\n\n\nHe is suggesting throughout the whole album how his own doubt about life, turned into a drive to succeed. Here he implies that even “righteous” minds go through doubt.\n\n Also, he could be saying that when you get fed up enough with your circumstances (growing up in the mean streets of NYC), that hustling is what it comes down to. The second line is saying while he isn’t the drug addict, he’s a fiend in his own right for money, and even righteous people get addicted to making dough.","status":"accepted"},{"text":"True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish\n Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders","annotation":"Jay claims that black culture has been corrupted: people feel compelled to blow their money on frivolous purchases like expensive jewelry and feel the need to always be paranoid and wary of the other people in their community\n\nIf you notice he said “bond with jewelers” and “watch” as a piece of jewelry from the jeweler.
